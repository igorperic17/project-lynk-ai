description: 'The Pegasus software is used as a pre-processor for overset-grid Computational
  Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations.  It provides the hole-cutting and connectivity
  information between structured overset grids.  The main features of the software
  include automated hole-cutting algorithms, a projection scheme for fixing small
  discretization errors in overset surface; efficient interpolation search methods;
  hole-size optimization based on adding additional layers of fringe points; and an
  automatic restart capability.  The code can run in parallel using the Message-Passing
  Interface (MPI) standard.  The parallel performance provides efficient speed-up
  of the execution time utilizing dozens or even hundreds of processors.  The additional
  capabilities in the new 5.2 version include: support for cell-centered grids; triple-fringe
  option; automated domain decomposition into multiple hole-cutters; improved parallel
  execution load-balancing algorithm; and additional minor enhancements.'
