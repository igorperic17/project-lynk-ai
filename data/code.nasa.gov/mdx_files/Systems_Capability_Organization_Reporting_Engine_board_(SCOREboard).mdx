description: 'The Systems Capability Organization Reporting Engine board (SCOREboard)
  was developed to integrate 12 sometime disparate data sets into a cohesive human
  exploration capability story that can be used to communicate NASAs exploration investments
  within the capability driven framework. The SCOREboards are graphical visualizations
  of SMT capability data that enable the EMC architecture and notional missions. The
  SCOREboards present an overview of multiple data points (the performance gaps and
  their durations, the corresponding gap closing tasks, task testing locations, mission
  need, and mission criticality) that when viewed together provide a roadmap of system
  maturation critical for the Journey to Mars. The SCOREboards are generated by a
  computer program that extracts data from the main repository, sorts the data based
  on a range of categories corresponding to the data structure, then plots the data
  according to specified user inputs. The ability to sort and plot varying data categories
  provides the flexibility to present specific SCOREboard capability roadmaps based
  on customer requests. '
