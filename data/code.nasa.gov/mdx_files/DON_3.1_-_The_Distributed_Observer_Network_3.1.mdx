description: "Distributed Observer Network 3 (DON3) is the innovation combination\
  \ of NASA simulation technologies, NASA information technologies and commercial\
  \ video game technology to provide a unique system that leverages the strengths\
  \ of all three.  A key component of the innovation is a standardized data interface\
  \ for simulation related information that is coupled with custom software integrated\
  \ into the game environment.  \r\n"
