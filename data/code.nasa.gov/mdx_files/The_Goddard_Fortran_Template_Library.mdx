description: This project provides Fortran templates for defining software containers.   Of
  necessity the capabilities are a bit manual as compared to C++ STL, but still quite
  useful.  Container types supported for now are Vector, Set, and Map.   Contained
  objects can be specified as any intrinsic type or derived type.   This includes
  deferred length strings and/or unlimited polymorphic entities.   The container can
  contain a single static type or allow for subtypes.   In the polymorphic case, the
  container can either keep deep copies (allocatable) or shallow references (pointer).
