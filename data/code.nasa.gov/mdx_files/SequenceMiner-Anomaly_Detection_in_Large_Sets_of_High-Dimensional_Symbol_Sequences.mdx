description: SequenceMiner was developed to address the problem of detecting and describing
  anomalies in large sets of high-dimensional symbol sequences. The technology performs
  unsupervised clustering (grouping) of sequences using the normalized longest common
  subsequence (LCS) as a similarity measure, followed by a detailed analysis of outliers
  to detect anomalies. SequenceMiner utilizes a new hybrid algorithm for computing
  the LCS that has been shown to outperform existing algorithms by a factor of five.
