description: 'This software provides a capability for robotic agents to have enough
  on-board self-awareness to dynamically adjust the information conveyed back to the
  Operations Center based on a detail level component analysis of requests. This is
  important because missing contextual information can lead to uncertainty in interpretation
  of data that is collected and possible errors in how an autonomous vehicle was commanded. '
