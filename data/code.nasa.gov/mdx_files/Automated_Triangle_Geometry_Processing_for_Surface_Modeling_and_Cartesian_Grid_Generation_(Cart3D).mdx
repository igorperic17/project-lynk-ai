description: Cart3D is a high-fidelity inviscid analysis package for conceptual and
  preliminary aerodynamic design. It allows users to perform automated computational
  fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis on complex geometry. The package includes utilities
  for geometry import, surface modeling and intersection, mesh generation, and flow
  simulation. Cart3D is highly automated so that geometry acquisition and mesh generation
  can usually be performed within a matter of minutes on most modern UNIX workstations
  or PCs.
