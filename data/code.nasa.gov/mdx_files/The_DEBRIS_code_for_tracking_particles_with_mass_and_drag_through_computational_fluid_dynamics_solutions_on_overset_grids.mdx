description: "The DEBRIS software performs particle tracking within an overset grid\
  \ system from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solution.  The particle tracking\
  \ is based on the particle's mass properties and local aerodynamic characteristics\
  \ within the flowfield.  The software allows the user to specify the location and\
  \ initial conditions for release of the particle.  The code then traces the particle's\
  \ ballistic trajectory (i.e. any lift force is ignored) through the grid system.\
  \  The resulting trajectory is output to a file which can be viewed/processed as\
  \ needed by the user.\r\n\r\nThe DEBRIS software was created to accurately and efficiently\
  \ analyze the debris transport environment for liberated debris from the Space Shuttle\
  \ Launch Vehicle (SSLV) during ascent.  The motivation for its development is a\
  \ consequence of the Columbia accident, where foam used to insulate the external\
  \ tank dislodged during ascent and struck the wing leading edge of the Orbiter.\
  \  The resulting impact critically breached the thermal protection system for the\
  \ wing, allowing hot gases to enter the structure of the vehicle, which led to the\
  \ catastrophic loss of crew and vehicle.\r\n"
