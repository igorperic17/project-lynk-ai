description: EDGE is a real-time 3d graphics rendering package based on the Dynamic
  On-board Ubiquitous Graphics (DOUG) graphics engine.  It combines key elements from
  graphics software tools developed for Space Shuttle and International Space Station
  (ISS) programs and adapts them for integration with other engineering simulations
  and facilities. The tool allows drop-in integration with the NASA Trick Simulation
  Environment and provides a fusion of 3D graphics and simulation outputs.
