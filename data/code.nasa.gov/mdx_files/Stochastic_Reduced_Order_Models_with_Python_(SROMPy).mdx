description: The Stochastic Reduced Order Models with Python (SROMPy) software package
  is code written in Python to help solve uncertainty quantification and propagation
  problems. Stochastic Reduced Order Models (SROMs) are low-dimensional, discrete
  representations of a given random vector being modeled that facilitate efficient
  stochastic calculations. SROMs can be viewed as a smart Monte Carlo method - using
  the concept for uncertainty propagation is similarly straightforward, but can significantly
  reduce computation time. An SROM is formed for a given target random vector by solving
  an optimization problem that determines it's parameters by minimizing the error
  between the statistics of the SROM and the target. Once the SROM is formed, it can
  be use to efficiently perform a probabilistic analysis. The SROMPy software package
  is a tool to solve the optimization problem efficiently to generate an SROM that
  can be used to propagate uncertainty through a given model.
