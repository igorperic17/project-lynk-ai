description: The Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program (GFSSP) is a general
  software tool that can perform complex fluid flow analysis in a wide variety of
  applications, including those related to chemical processing, gas processing, power
  plants, hydraulic control circuits, and various kinds of fluid distribution systems.
  Example problems can be used effectively as a teaching aid to students as part of
  their senior undergraduate or graduate coursework.
