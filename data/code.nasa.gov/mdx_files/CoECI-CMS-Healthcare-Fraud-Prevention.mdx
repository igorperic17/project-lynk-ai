description: Code from the Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership (HFPP) through
  United States Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) challenge in collaboration
  with NASA's Center of Excellence for Collaboration (CoECI), Harvard, and TopCoder
  developed software that supports a data exchange network that enables healthcare
  insurance-paying entities in both the public and private sector to safely and securely
  share information for purposes of prevention and detection of fraud, waste and abuse
  across partners.
