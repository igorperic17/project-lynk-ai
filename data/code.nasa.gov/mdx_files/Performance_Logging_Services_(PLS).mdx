description: Working in real time and using very little memory and CPU, Performance
  Logging Services (PLS) is an innovative software-performance monitoring tool that
  tracks statistics on timing and buffer usage. To assist in troubleshooting, PLS
  will start or stop other software tools when performance requirements are out of
  specification. The technology has been used in the Checkout and Launch Control System
  on NASA's Space Shuttle program.
