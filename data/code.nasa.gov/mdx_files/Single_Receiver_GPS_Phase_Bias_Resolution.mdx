description: 'It has long been the practice to fix double differenced integer phase
  ambiguities when processing GPS data from multiple receivers. When the double differenced
  combination of phase biases can be fixed reliably a significant improvement in solution
  accuracy is obtained. The procedure is complicated and compute intensive, due to
  the need for multiple receivers to form the double difference. The constraint on
  the integers is added to the solution as a measurement with infinite precision.
  This software introduces a new method. First the process, uses a large global set
  of GPS receivers (40-80 receivers) to solve for the GPS satellite orbits and clocks
  ( along with many other parameters ). '
