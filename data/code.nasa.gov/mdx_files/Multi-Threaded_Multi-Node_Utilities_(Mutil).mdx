description: Mutil is a set of standard utilities that employ multiple types of parallelism
  and other optimizations to achieve maximum performance on modern file systems. Multi-threading
  is used to ensure that nodes are kept as busy as possible. Double buffering allows
  individual operations within a single task to be overlapped using asynchronous I/O.
  Multi-node cooperation allows different nodes to take part in the same task. Split
  file processing allows multiple threads to operate concurrently on the same file.
  Finally, additional optimizations such as buffer management help eliminate other
  bottlenecks that can reduce performance. Mutil currently includes drop-in replacements
  for cp and md5sum from GNU coreutils, which have achieved 10/30x rates on one/many
  nodes.
