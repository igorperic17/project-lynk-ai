description: 'This software implements the NTP algorithm for Space communications
  and can be used as a basis for further higher TRL prototype or flight software development.
  It is an implementation to test the functionality of NTP basic and interleaved Symmetric
  algorithm that can be integrated with CCSDS Prox-1 to provide the time distribution
  and synchronization service. '
