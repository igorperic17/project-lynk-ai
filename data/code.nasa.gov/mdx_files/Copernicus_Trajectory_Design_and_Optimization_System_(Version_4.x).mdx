description: "Copernicus v4.4 is a new release of the Copernicus spacecraft trajectory\
  \ design and optimization program.  This is an update to version 4.3, which was\
  \ released in February 2016.  The new version includes:  \r\nA new option to use\
  \ plugins to adjust the initial guess for the optimization problem.\r\nNew 3D graphics\
  \ updates (including a fix to a long-standing issue where the texture maps didnt\
  \ always render properly on PCs with Intel HD graphics).\r\nWhen running Copernicus\
  \ in command-line mode, paths can now be specified as relative paths, and can also\
  \ include environment variables.\r\nNew GUI menu to only autoscale the badly-scaled\
  \ optimization variables.\r\nUpdated SPICE leap second kernel (naif0012).\r\nUpdated\
  \ Copernicus/Python interface library\r\nNumerous other minor features and bug fixes"
