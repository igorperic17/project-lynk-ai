description: MIDAS is a 3D rapid-prototyping human-performance modeling environment
  that facilitates the design, visualization, and computational evaluation of complex
  man-machine system concepts in simulated operational environments. The tool links
  a virtual human to a computational cognitive structure that represents human capabilities
  and limitations. MIDAS operates on a Microsoft Windows-based PC platform. An easy-to-use
  graphical user interface makes the software an accessible tool for designers; no
  expertise in computer science, programming, or human performance modeling is required.
