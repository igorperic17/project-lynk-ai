description: The Data Productivity Toolkit is a collection of linux command-line tools
  designed to facilitate the analysis of text-based data sets. Modeled after the general
  linux pipeline tools such as awk, grep, and sed, the kit provides powerful tools
  for selecting/combining data, performing statistics, and visualizing results. The
  tools are all written in python and in many instances provide a command-line API
  to basic python and numpy/scipy/matplotlib routines.
