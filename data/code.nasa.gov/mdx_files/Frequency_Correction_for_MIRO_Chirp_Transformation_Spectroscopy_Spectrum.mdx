description: 'A lightweight, uncooled dual-frequency heterodyne radiometer named MIRO
  is developed for the European Space Agency Rosetta mission to Comet 67P. MIRO contains
  a 4096 channel CTS spectrometer which has 180 MHz total bandwidth and 4 KHz resolution.
  The CTS channels translate into 8 molecular transition bands. The MIRO CTS will
  measure direct outgassing of four major volatile species from the cometary nucleus
  (H2O, CO, CH3OH, and NH3). It will also measure the fundamental isotopo ratios,
  17O/16O and 18O/16O, using the isotopologues H216O and H217O, and H218O. '
