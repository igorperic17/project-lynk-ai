description: 'The NASA Operational Simulator (NOS) Common software  is a collection
  of libraries and applications that have been developed to support the development
  and maintenance of pure software spacecraft emulators and associated technologies.   The
  NOS Common software applications were designed to be project agnostic and flexible
  to support any implementation.  The most notable utilities include the NOS logging
  and NOS utils libraries.  The NOS logging library is a lightweight and easy-to-use
  logging framework.  The NOS util library is an all-purpose library to house various
  generic solutions to common development problems.  These include generic pooling
  mechanism, a specialized threading pool, and a custom assert mechanism.  The threading
  pool allows cross-platform thread management to any application or library with
  very low user interaction.  The custom assert mechanism is designed to not have
  certain error checking implementations removed during compile time under release
  configurations. '
