description: The VLOADS program calculates launch vehicles' in-flight structural loads
  for preliminary design.  The program may also be used to calculate structural loads
  for upper stages and planetary transfer vehicles.  Launch vehicle information and
  input data such as aerodynamic coefficients, mass properties, propellants, engine
  thrusts, and performance data are compiled and analyzed by VLOADS to produce distributed
  shear loads, bending moments, axial forces, and vehicle line loads as a function
  of X-station along the vehicle's length.  Translational accelerations and interface
  loads, if the launch vehicle has booseters or wings, are also computed.
