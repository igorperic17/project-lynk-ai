description: The Kalman Filter Code Augmentation release is a modification of Kalman
  Filter Toolbox, written by Kevin Murphy, 1998. It extends the existing open source
  software's capabilities and functionality by bookkeeping more detailed information
  on internal data structures, as well as ensuring the consistency of mathematical
  conventions used by subroutines that are part of a third-party tool called ASOS
  as part of the modification. Additional convergence criteria have also been included,
  as well as the possibility for establishing additional constraints and modelling
  paradigms.
