description: 'The search interface in the MSLICE program works via a ReST-based URL
  for any query that the user constructs. In other words, as the user adds and removes
  components of the search a URL is constructed to corresponds to that search. By
  leveraging this URL, we are able to emulate much of the functionality of a web browser
  within the search features of the desktop application MSLICE. Back and forward buttons
  allow the user to quickly and easily move through their search history, while the
  refresh button reloads the query to display any new data that may match the current
  query. '
