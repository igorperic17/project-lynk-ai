description: "The Field Campaign eXplorer (FCX) is developed at the Global Hydrometeorology\
  \ Resource Center (GHRC) to address data exploration needs in portraying the interactive\
  \ nature of multiple datasets that are obtained in a concerted field campaign.\n\
  \nThe FCX has been built to explore the diverse multi-stream coincident datasets\
  \ through several field campaigns whose data are managed and archived at GHRC. FCX\
  \ is a web-based and cloud-native system that visualizes multiple datasets in a\
  \ time-dynamic, 3-dimensional display with supplemental data analysis. The web-based\
  \ feature delivers visualization without the requirement of a graphical software\
  \ system and being cloud-native allows for sharing of the data and visualization.\n\
  \nFCX offers a system for coincident visualization and analysis. Scientific analysis\
  \ typically requires intercomparisons and cross-references. This enables the investigation\
  \ of the environment and how individual observations come together to explain the\
  \ larger whole. FCX offers a means with which to more readily bring together many,\
  \ often disparate, datasets in a common frame of reference without requiring the\
  \ user to develop these capabilities. Further, as more data become publicly available\
  \ in the cloud, FCX\u2019s open source abilities facilitate not only cross-DAAC\
  \ collaborations but ultimately cross-organization collaborations."
