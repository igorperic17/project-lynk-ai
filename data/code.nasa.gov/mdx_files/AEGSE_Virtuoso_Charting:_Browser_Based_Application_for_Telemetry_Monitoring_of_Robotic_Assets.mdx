description: 'AEGSE Virtuoso Charting enables animated real time charting of telemetry
  streams of data from the rover.  The high performance application offers real-time
  telemetry monitoring through animated charts.  These automatically scaled charts
  are completely interactive and allow users to choose the variables that they want
  to monitor.  Furthermore, these charts were designed for extremely high performance,
  and they can process data from streams with many variables at such high frequencies
  as 100Hz. '
