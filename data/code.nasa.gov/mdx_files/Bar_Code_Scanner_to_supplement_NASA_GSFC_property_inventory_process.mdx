description: A method to perform an informal property inventory has been developed
  that serves to supplement the official NASA GSFC Property Inventory.  This informal
  approach uses a Metrologic/Honeywell Scanpal2 Bar Code Scanner along with Microsoft
  Excel macros that take the scanner output data and updates an organization's database
  derived from NASA's N-PROP property management on-line database.
