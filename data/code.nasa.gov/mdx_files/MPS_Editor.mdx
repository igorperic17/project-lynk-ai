description: 'The MPS Editor is written in Java using the Eclipse Rich Client Platform.
  The editor allows users to start in the early phases of development and continue
  on through the operations phases. It is currently built with four perspectives:
  the Activity Dictionary Perspective, the Project Adaptation Perspective, the Sequence
  Building Perspective and the Sequence Modeling Perspective. Each perspective performs
  a given task.The MPS editor uses the Eclipse Rich Client Platform to provide an
  environment that can be tailored to specific missions easily. It give them the capability
  to create/edit and Activity Dictionary, to build the simulation spacecraft models,
  to build and edit sequences of commands and to model the effect of those commands
  on the spacecraft.'
