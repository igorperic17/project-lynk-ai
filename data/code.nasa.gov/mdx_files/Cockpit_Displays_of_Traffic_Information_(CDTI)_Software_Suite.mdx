description: 'CDTI consists of two main components: (1) the Pulse Predictor for Traffic
  Display Tool, which allows a user to compare a representation of his own expected
  trajectory with those of other traffic elements; and (2) the Flight-Deck-Based Flight
  Plan Modification Tool, which allows flight crew members to display and modify their
  flight plans graphically, check for predicted conflicts, and load changes into the
  flight management system.'
