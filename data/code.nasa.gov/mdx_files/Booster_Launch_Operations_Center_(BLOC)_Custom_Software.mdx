description: The Booster Launch Operations Center provided NASA with real-time monitoring
  of the Space Shuttle's integrated testing while it was in the Vehicle Assembly Building
  (VAB) or on the launch pad. USA Design Engineering manned the facility and used
  this software to monitor the Solid Rocket Booster subsystems (i.e., Range Safety,
  Electrical and Instrumentation, and Thrust Vector Control) using a data feed from
  the main firing room.
