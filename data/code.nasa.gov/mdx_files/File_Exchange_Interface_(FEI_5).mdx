description: The File Exchange Interface (FEI) service offers secure file transaction,
  storage, transportation, and management services. The tool is implemented with the
  latest Java technologies for maximum portability and supports a 64-bit file system
  for very large file transfers over secure socket connections. While database-driven
  for file transactions and user access management, FEI offers an interactive client
  software suite for managing administration and general use.
