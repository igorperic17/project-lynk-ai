description: A computer program to translate Unified Modeling Language (UML) Free-form
  Implementation Diagrams into a legacy C implementation of a Behavior Network has
  been developed in order to simplify the development of C-code for behavior based
  control systems. UML is a popular standard developed by the Object Management Group
  (OMG) to model software architectures graphically. The C implementation of a Behavior
  Network is functioning as a decision tree. Simplfying the process of behavior-based
  control code generation. The autocoding approach used in this work is derived from
  that previously applied to NASA missions such as the Mars Science Laboratory.
