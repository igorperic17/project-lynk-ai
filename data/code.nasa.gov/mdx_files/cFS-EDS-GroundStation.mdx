description: 'This software package primarily consists of a python based graphical
  user interface (GUI) which serves as a generic telemetry and telecommand system
  for any mission that uses core flight systems (cFS) with CCSDS Electronic Data Sheets
  (EDS) support.  The GUI utilizes python bindings to automatically read all of the
  information contained in the mission''s EDS Library and Core Flight Executive (CFE)
  Mission Library.


  On the telecommand side this allows instance names, topic names, and subcommand
  names to be automatically populated in drop-down menus.  Command that require a
  payload will produce text boxes or drop-down menus for user entry.  Finally, completed
  commands are packed and sent to the desired core flight instance.


  On the telemetry side, the GUI will continuously listen for messages.  When messages
  arrive, they are decoded, the contents are displayed to the screen, sorted by topic,
  and saved internally.  Telemetry messages can be saved to binary files for further
  processing.


  Also included are several utility python scripts.  Two such scripts perform the
  command sending and telemetry decoding functionality of the GUI.  The third reads
  in the saved telemetry data files and converts the messages into a CSV format which
  can be loaded in an Excel type program.'
