description: Livingstone2 is a reusable artificial intelligence (AI) software system
  designed to assist spacecraft, life support systems, chemical plants or other complex
  systems in operating robustly with minimal human supervision, even in the face of
  hardware failures or unexpected events. Livingstone2 diagnoses the current state
  of the spacecraft or other system and recommends commands or repair actions that
  will allow the system to continue operations.
