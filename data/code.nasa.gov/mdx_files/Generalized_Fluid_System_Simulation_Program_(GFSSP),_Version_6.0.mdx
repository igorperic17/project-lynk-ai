description: The Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program (GFSSP) is a general
  software tool that can perform complex fluid flow analysis in a wide variety of
  applications, including those related to chemical processing, gas processing, power
  plants, hydraulic control circuits, and various kinds of fluid distribution systems.
  The tool models liquid fuel phase changes that include compressibility and mixture
  thermodynamics and allows the user to apply and vary "what-if" effects of external
  influences.
