description: Severe weather clouds exhibit distinct patterns in satellite imagery.
  These patterns, commonly referred to as overshooting cloud tops (OTs) and above
  anvil cirrus plumes (AACPs), are routinely observed by the human-eye in satellite
  imagery atop the most intense storms on Earth. With the latest geostationary high
  spatio-temporal resolution satellite imagers such as, GOES-16 and GOES-17, these
  severe weather patterns are being observed better than ever before. Advances in
  deep learning methods allow us to not only detect these signatures but also automate
  the detection process for real-time applications. Our software code was developed
  in Python and contains up to 3 model types, U-Net, MultiResU-Net, and AttentionU-Net
  with varying geostationary satellite channels used as model inputs. The MultiresU-Net
  model has been found to identify the severe storm signatures better than the other
  2 model types and will likely be the only model packaged in the software release.
  The models' were trained using a large database of OT and AACP patterns identified
  from human analysts based on 1-minute GOES-16 ABI imagery. In testing, the models
  have been shown to successfully detect OTs and AACPs with high precision. The software
  has also successfully been run for real-time and archived applications. The goal
  of this software is for users to accurately detect these severe storm signatures
  for a variety of forecast and research applications.
