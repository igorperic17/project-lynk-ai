description: 'This software comprises a set of individual tools (written in Perl,
  C, and C++) that perform a variety of useful searches and shortcuts thathelp streamline
  MER mission operations. Functions include: Generating text-only, annotated, and
  web-enhanced views of command sequences - Labeling integer enumerations with their
  symbolic meaning in textmessages (EVRs) and and engineering channels (EH&A) - Systematic
  detection of corruption within data products - Text-only displays of data product
  catalogs and downlink status - Validation and labeling of commands related to data
  products - Convenient searches over any number of Martian Solar Days (sols) - EH&A
  initial conditions table generation - Simplified construction and simulation of
  command sequences - Time conversion'
