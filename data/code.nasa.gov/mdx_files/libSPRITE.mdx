description: 'libSPRITE is a set of libraries that have been used on several past
  projects including flight, technology demonstration, and simulation projects.


  libSPRITE provides a diverse set of functions to attempt to simplify coding and
  reduce code errors. For example, libSPRITE defines engineering units as types (i.e.,
  Meters or Radians instead of double or int). It includes an engineering unit aware
  math library.


  libSPRITE includes a task scheduling system that abstracts pthreads and includes
  a publish subscribe data system for data routing.


  In addition, libSPRITE includes an optional binding to the Lua scripting language
  for configuring the program, setting parameters, running Lua scripts within C++
  tasks and even interacting with the application during runtime.'
