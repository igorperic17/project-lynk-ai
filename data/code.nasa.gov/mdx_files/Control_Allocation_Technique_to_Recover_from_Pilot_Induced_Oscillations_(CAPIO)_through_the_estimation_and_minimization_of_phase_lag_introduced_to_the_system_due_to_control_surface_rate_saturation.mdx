description: The Control Allocation Technique to Recover from Pilot Induced Oscillations
  (CAPIO) system is designed to operate within an aircraft's flight control system
  to alleviate Pilot Induced Oscillation tendencies in an aircraft without adversely
  impacting aircraft efficiency. The main idea behind the concept is to minimize the
  phase lag introduced to the system due to control surface rate saturation. The CAPIO
  system is designed specifically for multi-input/multi-output applications and this
  implementation utilizes 1) on-line estimation of phase lag introduced by control
  surface rate limiting, 2) on-line adjustment of control allocation weighting terms,
  and 3) an optimization algorithm (available from MathWorks) that calculates the
  optimal control solution.
