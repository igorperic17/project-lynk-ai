description: The Vehicle Cabin Atmosphere Monitor (VCAM) is a miniature preconcentrator/gas
  chromatograph/mass spectrometer (PCGC/MS) system to be used to identify and quantify
  trace chemicals. The immediate application is to provide a needed trace-gas monitor
  for the International Space Station.  This software solves the problem of quantifying
  the concentration of trace chemicals in the International Space Station (ISS) internal
  air using a miniature gas-chromatograph mass-spectrometer instrument called VCAM.
