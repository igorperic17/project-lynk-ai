description: 'The AAC algorithm generates resolution trajectories through a multi-step
  iterative process: (1) a resolution generator performs the analytical and logical
  functions; (2) a 4D trajectory synthesizer integrates aircraft equations of motion
  using detailed models of aircraft performance, operational procedures, and atmospheric
  conditions; and (3) a conflict detector compares trial resolution trajectories against
  the 4D trajectories of all other aircraft in an airspace of interest.'
