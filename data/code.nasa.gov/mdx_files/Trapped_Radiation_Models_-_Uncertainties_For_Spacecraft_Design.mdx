description: "The focus of Trapped Radiation Models software development effort was\
  \ to help spacecraft and payload designers to account for uncertainties in predictive\
  \ models of the Earth's trapped radiation environment. A tool was needed for more\
  \ accurately determining radiation requirements and risks -- essential elements\
  \ for producing less expensive, more reliable spacecraft.\r\n"
