description: 'Extreme heat causes and exacerbates a number of health problems, leading
  to hospitalization and death in some cases. The problem of severe heat is notably
  felt in Maricopa County, Arizona, where the socially disadvantaged and physically
  vulnerable are especially susceptible to the effects of extreme heat. Several organizations,
  including the Arizona Department of Health Services and the Phoenix Heat Relief
  Network, are working to create more effectively placed cooling centers and heat
  warning systems to aid those with the highest risk of exposure. This project created
  a Python tool using Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) land surface
  temperature parameters to generate heat maps that reference demographics data on
  extreme heat days. '
