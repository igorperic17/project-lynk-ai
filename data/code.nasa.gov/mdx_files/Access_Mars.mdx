description: "The Curiosity rover has been on the surface of Mars for over five years.\
  \ In that time, it has sent over 200,000 photos back to Earth. Using these photos,\
  \ engineers at JPL have reconstructed the 3D surface of Mars for their scientists\
  \ to use as a mission planning tool \u2013 surveying the terrain and identifying\
  \ geologically significant areas for Curiosity to investigate further. And now you\
  \ can explore the same Martian surface in your browser in an immersive WebVR experience.\
  \ Access Mars features four important mission locations: the Landing Site, Pahrump\
  \ Hills, Marias Pass, and Murray Buttes. Additionally, users can visit Curiosity's\
  \ 'Current Location' for a look at where the rover has been in the past two to four\
  \ weeks. And while you explore it all, JPL scientist Katie Stack Morgan will be\
  \ your guide, teaching you about key mission details and highlighting points of\
  \ interest."
