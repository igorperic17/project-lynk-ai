description: Designed to assess advanced automation concepts and procedures being
  considered for the next-generation air traffic management system, VAST-RT offers
  real-time simulations across all air traffic control domains. Gate-to-gate simulations
  can involve piloted flight simulators, multiple NASA centers, TRACONS, and towers.
  The software's architecture links disparate legacy facilities together with simulation
  components developed in house.
