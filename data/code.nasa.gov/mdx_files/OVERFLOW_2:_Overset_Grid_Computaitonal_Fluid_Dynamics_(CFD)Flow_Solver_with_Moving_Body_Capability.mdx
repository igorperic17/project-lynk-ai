description: OVERFLOW 2 is a computer code for simulating viscous, compressible fluid
  flow about complex aerodynamic configurations. The technology solves the Reynolds-averaged
  Navier-Stokes equations using structured, overset computational grids. It includes
  the capability for simulating multiple moving bodies acting under prescribed or
  aerodynamically forced motion. OVERFLOW 2 is a merge of the previously developed
  OVERFLOW 1.8 and OVERFLOW-D codes.
