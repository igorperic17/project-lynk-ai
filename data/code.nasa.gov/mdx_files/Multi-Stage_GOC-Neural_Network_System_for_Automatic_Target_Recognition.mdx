description: A multi-stage automated target recognition (ATR) system has been designed
  to perform computer vision tasks with adequate proficiency in mimicking human vision.
  The system is able to detect, identify, and track targets of interest. A feed forward
  back propagation neural network (NN) is then trained to classify each feature vector
  and remove false positives. The system  parameter optimizations process has been
  developed to adapt to various targets and datasets.
