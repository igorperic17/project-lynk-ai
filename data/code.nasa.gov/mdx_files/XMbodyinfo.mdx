description: 'The software is very useful for streamlining the spacecraft tour design
  process.This software has already been successfully used on Cassini. It can also
  be used rather easily for other Cassini type missions such as the upcoming Europa
  mission. On Cassini many of hours were saved in the evaluation of the extended mission
  and extended-extended mission tours. The science optimization and overall science
  return increase as result of this software was tremendous but cannot be estimated
  precisely. '
