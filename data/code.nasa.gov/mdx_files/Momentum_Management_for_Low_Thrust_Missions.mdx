description: 'MomProf was developed to operate in the MATLAB environment providing
  an easy user interface. All data is loaded into MATLAB as a structure to provide
  easy, consistent access to all inputs by individual functions within the tool. A
  configuration file provides infrequently changed parameters such as RWA inertia,
  S/C inertia, and the rotation matrix defining the alignment of the each RWA in the
  Body frame.  The tab delimited input file contains time, attitude, s/c rate, and
  mode information.  Used in its most basic application, the Dawn momentum tool uses
  the basic principle of angular momentum computing momentum in the body frame, and
  RWA wheel speeds, for all given orientations in the input file. '
