description: 'The Space Images for NASA JPL is an iPhone application system which
  allows the General Public to view and rate images directly from an individual''s
  iPhone. This system consists of four distinguishing components: image repository,
  database, server-side logic, and iPhone application. The image repository contains
  JPL planetary and mission images from various projects. The database stores the
  image information as well as the user rating. The server-side logic retrieves the
  image information from the database and categorizes each image for display. '
