description: This software library was developed to mitigate the public safety risks
  of hazards associated with the flight of expendable launch vehicles and other unmanned
  flight vehicles. The software encapsulates the various constructs and algorithms
  required to accomplish Time Space Position Information (TSPI) data management from
  multiple tracking sources. At its core, the technology evaluates various user-configurable
  rule sets that govern the qualification of TSPI data sources; provides a pre-launch
  autonomous hold-launch function; performs flight-monitoring/flight-termination functions;
  and provides end-of-mission safing.
