description: The Vehicle Sketch Pad (VSP) is an aircraft geometry tool for rapid evaluation
  of advanced design concepts. Fast and accurate geometry modeling allows the designer
  to use more complex analysis methods earlier in the design process and reduces reliance
  on empiricism in conceptual design. VSP includes tools to model and export the internal
  structural layout.
