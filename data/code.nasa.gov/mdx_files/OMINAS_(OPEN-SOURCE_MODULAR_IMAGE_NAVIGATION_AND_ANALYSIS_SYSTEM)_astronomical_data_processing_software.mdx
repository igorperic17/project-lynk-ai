description: 'The primary motivation for the development of this software was to separate
  the analysis part of the problem from the data-specific part. This allows the exact
  same software to be used for multiple missions as needed; the only requirement for
  new mission input is the creation of a translator specific to that data source.
  Provides an API and for developing tools for astronomical data analysis. '
