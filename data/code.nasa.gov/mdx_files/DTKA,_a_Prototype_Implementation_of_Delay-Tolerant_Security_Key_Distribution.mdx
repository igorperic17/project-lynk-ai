description: 'Unlike all Internet mechanisms for security distribution (e.g., certificate
  authorities), DTKA operates over the extremely long signal propagation times and
  interrupted links that characterize communication with interplanetary spacecraft.
  It has no single point of failure and cannot be "spoofed" by an attacker''s subversion
  of any single key authority machine (or even two key authority machines, in most
  configurations.  '
