description: NDARC software is an aircraft system analysis tool that supports both
  conceptual design efforts and technology impact assessments of rotorcraft that meet
  specified requirements. The architecture of the NDARC code accommodates configuration
  flexibility, a hierarchy of models, and ultimately multidisciplinary design, analysis,
  and optimization.
