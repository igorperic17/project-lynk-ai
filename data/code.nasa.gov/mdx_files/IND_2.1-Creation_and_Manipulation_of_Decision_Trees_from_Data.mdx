description: Decision trees are commonly used in artificial intelligence and statistical
  pattern recognition. A tree is "grown" from data using a recursive-partitioning
  algorithm. IND re-implements parts of existing standard prediction algorithms, offers
  experimental control suites, and also introduces new, more sophisticated methods
  for growing decision trees.
