description: The Trick Simulation environment is a generic simulation toolkit used
  for constructing and running simulations.  The Trick 13 Interface Code Generator
  (ICG), a utility that provides math model class and structure layout data, has been
  rewritten and is based off of the open source clang/llvm project.  The Trick numerical
  integrators have been replaced with a common set of integrators.  Several core components
  are enhanced from previous Trick versions.  Trick 13 is now Open Source software
  and can be downloaded at http://code.nasa.gov/#/
