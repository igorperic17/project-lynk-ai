description: 'This development effort modified cFE/CFS flight software components
  to enable them to run on a multi-core processor or an embedded operating system
  that supports multi-core processors (e.g., VxWorks 6 and Linux). Modified components
  included: the Operating System Abstraction Layer (OSAL), the Core Flight Executive
  (cFE), and parts of the Core Flight System (CFS). These modifications did not add
  any additional application functionality to the Operating System Abstraction Layer
  OSAL or the cFE.'
