description: 'A software application was developed to visualize orbit paths for the
  Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO). This software enables interactive exploration
  of spacecraft orbit paths and ground footprint paths in a 3D environment. Detailed
  information about any particular observation frame is available through a point-and-click
  "drill down" capability. '
