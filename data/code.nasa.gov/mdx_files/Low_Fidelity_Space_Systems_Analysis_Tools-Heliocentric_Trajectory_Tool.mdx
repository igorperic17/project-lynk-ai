description: This tool is produced is take advantage of pre-existing resources of
  known lambert trajectory solutions to various bodies, NEA's and more. This database
  is created and maintained by Ames Research Center and provides a two significant
  figure estimate of the injection deltaV to get to the desired orbit and the insertion
  dV to stop at the location. Additionally, it does calculate flyby maneuver effects.
