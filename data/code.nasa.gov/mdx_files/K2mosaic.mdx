description: 'K2mosaic is a command-line tool that makes it easy to combine CCD pixel
  data obtained by NASA''s Kepler space telescope into wide-field images. The need
  for this tool arises from the fact that the two-wheeled extended Kepler mission,
  K2, observed large clusters and moving targets (e.g. planets, comets, and asteroids). '
