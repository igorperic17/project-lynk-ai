description: This NASA-developed technology includes a set of partial differential
  equations that augment the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equation. By providing
  a mechanism that allows flow history to affect turbulence stresses, Lag Model mimics
  underlying physical processes to provide an improved turbulence model for flows
  with separation.
