description: The MDP toolbox for Python by Sam Cordwell provides classes and functions
  for the resolution of descrete-time Markov Decision Processes. The list of algorithms
  that have been implemented includes backwards induction, linear programming, policy
  iteration, q-learning and value iteration along with several variations.
