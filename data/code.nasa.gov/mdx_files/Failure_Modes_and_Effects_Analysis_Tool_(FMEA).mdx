description: "The scope of this project is to develop a prototype failure analysis\
  \ software tool. The tool models a system's components, their connective relationships,\
  \ and functions in order to assist in Failure Modes and Effect analysis (FMEA) early\
  \ in the design lifecycle.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the tool is to semi-automatically\
  \ generate a model with functions and failure modes to support FMEA.  This will\
  \ be accomplished by:\r\nA graphical component-connection model is created by arranging\
  \ and connecting components selected from the Master Equipment list.\r\n\r\nFor\
  \ each component, a pick-list user interface asks a few questions to narrow down\
  \ potential failure modes.  This uses a failure mode library in MS Excel based on\
  \ standard failure modes and associated component functions and features.\r\n\r\n\
  Pick-lists for types failure mode causes and immediate effects help the analyst\
  \ complete initial draft FMEA worksheets, which link to the components in the model.\r\
  \n\r\nThe graphical model, which is marked with redundant components and paths,\
  \ shows upstream/downstream dependencies, to help the analyst add further effects\
  \ and criticality to the FMEA worksheets.\r\n\r\nThis tool is innovative because\
  \ it saves analysis time and provides a standardized and systematic approach in\
  \ failure analysis, thereby enabling risk mitigation early in system design.  There\
  \ are also potential benefits of tool use during the operations phase to identify\
  \ the cause(s) of a fault or failure.   \r\n"
