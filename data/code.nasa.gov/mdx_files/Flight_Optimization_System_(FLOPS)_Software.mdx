description: 'The Flight Optimization System (FLOPS) is a multidisciplinary system
  of computer programs for conceptual and preliminary design and evaluation of advanced
  aircraft concepts.  It consists of six primary modules:  1) weights, 2) aerodynamics,
  3) propulsion data scaling and interpolation, 4) mission performance, 5) takeoff
  and landing, and 6) program control.'
