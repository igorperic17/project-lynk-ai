description: VCAM can provide a means for monitoring the air within the enclosed environments,
  such as the ISS, Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), a Lunar Habitat, or another vehicle
  traveling to Mars. Its miniature preconcentrator, gas chromatograph (GC), and mass
  spectrometer can provide unbiased detection of a large number of organic species.
  VCAM's software can identify whether the chemicals are on a targeted list of hazardous
  compounds and their concentration.
