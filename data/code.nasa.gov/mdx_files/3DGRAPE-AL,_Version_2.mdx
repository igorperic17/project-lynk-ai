description: As the size and complexity of three dimensional volume grids increases,
  there is a growing need for fast and efficient 3D volumetric elliptic grid solvers.
  Present day solvers are limited by computational speed and do not have all the capabilities
  such as interior volume grid clustering control, viscous grid clustering at the
  wall of a configuration, truncation error limiters, block-to-block C-I continuity,
  convergence optimization, and MPI parallel computing residing in one code. A new
  volume grid generator, 3DGRAPE/AL (Three-Dimensional Grids about Anything by Poisson
  Equations with Ames and Langley upgrades), which is based on the original 3DGRAPE
  and 3DMAGGS codes, has evolved to meet these needs. The distribution comes with
  the source code, installation instructions, sample problems, and pre- and post-processors
  for evaluating grid smoothing convergence and interfacing to GRIDGEN/POINTWISE.
