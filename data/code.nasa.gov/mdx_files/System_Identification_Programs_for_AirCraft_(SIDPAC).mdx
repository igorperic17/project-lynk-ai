description: Written in MATLAB, SIDPAC is a collection of over 300 programs that perform
  a wide variety of tasks related to system identification applied to aircraft. SIDPAC
  includes tools for experiment design, data analysis, kinematic consistency checking,
  static and dynamic modeling, simulation, numerical integration and differentiation,
  smoothing, filtering, finite Fourier transformation, statistical modeling and evaluation,
  optimization, parameter estimation, model accuracy quantification, model validation,
  and more.
