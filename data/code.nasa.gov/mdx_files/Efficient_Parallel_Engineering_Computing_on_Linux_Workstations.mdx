description: 'This software provides an off-the-shelf approach to high-performance
  engineering computing that finds numerous applications in NASA aeronautical and
  space mission analysis and simulations. A C software module has been developed that
  creates light weight processes (LWP) dynamically to achieve parallel computing performance
  in a variety of engineering simulation and analysis applications. '
