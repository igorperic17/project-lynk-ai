description: 'The Composite Damage (CompDam) Progressive Damage Analysis software
  is developed for the prediction of damage onset, damage progression and structural
  collapse of structures manufactured of fiber-reinforced plastic laminates. The emphasis
  has been on development of an analysis capability for application at the structural
  level. Hence, modeling of damage progression is undertaken at the meso-scale, where
  each ply of a laminate is represented as a homogenous orthotropic continuum. All
  of the composite damage mechanisms (matrix cracking, fiber breaking and kinking,
  and delamination) and their interactions are represented. The CompDam software is
  implemented as user written subroutines for use with the Abaqus commercial finite
  element code.  Input for CompDam includes ply-level material properties, and interface
  properties obtained from standard material characterization tests.  The output from
  CompDam includes damage variables associated with each damage mode. These damage
  variables describe the evolution of damage and are used to generate updated structural
  constitutive matrices and load redistribution as damage evolves. '
