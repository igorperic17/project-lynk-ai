description: 'This software is used in an automated cryogenic control system developed
  to monitor and control the operation of small-scale crycoolers. The system was designed
  to automate cryogenically cooled low-noise-amplifier systems used in the NASA Deep
  Space Network (DSN). It automates the entire operation of the system including cool
  down, warm-up and performance monitoring. '
