description: This repository consists of the various scripts required to make our
  VADER system work. The variable emissivity radiator aerogel insulation blanket dual
  zone thermal control experiment suite for responsive space (STP-H3-VADER) investigation
  tests a variable emissivity radiator and a new form of multilayer insulation that
  uses Aerogel as the thermal isolator in order to protect the spacecraft from the
  harsh extremes of the space environment. The Aerogel material provides a more durable,
  lighter and cheaper alternative to traditional spacecraft thermal blankets. The
  use of this material could reduce the costs related to spaceflight by reducing the
  required spacecraft mass and increasing design efficiency.
