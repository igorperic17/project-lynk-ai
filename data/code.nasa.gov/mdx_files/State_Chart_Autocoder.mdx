description: This NASA technology automatically generates code from UML/SysML state-machine
  models specified in the MagicDraw modeling tool. Input is saved as XML data files,
  and output is provided by the state-machine implementation code in C, C++, Python,
  or Promela. A test suite validates output products, and a test harness allows a
  developer to execute and animate a model with a graphical state-machine monitor.
  This monitor can run as either a standalone tool or as an Eclipse plug-in to MagicDraw.
