description: The IVHM Project in the Aviation Safety Program has funded research in
  electrical power system (EPS) health management. This problem domain contains both
  discrete and continuous behavior, and thus is directly relevant for the hybrid diagnostic
  tool HyDE. In FY2007 work was performed to expand the HyDE diagnosis model of the
  ADAPT system. The work completed resulted in a HyDE model with the capability to
  diagnose five times the number of ADAPT components than was previously tested. The
  expanded diagnosis model passed a corresponding set of new ADAPT fault injection
  scenario tests with no incorrect faults reported. The time required for the HyDE
  diagnostic system to isolate the fault varied widely between tests; this variance
  was reduced by tuning of the HyDE input parameters. These results and other diagnostic
  design tradeoffs are discussed. Finally, possible future improvements for both the
  HyDE diagnostic model and HyDE itself are presented.
