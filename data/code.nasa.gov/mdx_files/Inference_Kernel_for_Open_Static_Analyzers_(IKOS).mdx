description: 'IKOS is a C++ library designed to facilitate the development of sound
  static analyzers based on Abstract Interpretation. Specialization of a static analyzer
  for an application or family of applications is critical for achieving both precision
  and scalability. Developing such an analyzer is arduous and requires significant
  expertise in Abstract Interpretation. '
