description: 'REST-based web services are a great tool for connecting a diverse set
  of components together in a clean and simple fashion. Ensemble REST makes it easy
  for developers to write and deploy RESTful web applications, and the HTTP protocol
  enables anyone to access and utilize the exposed services.  There are libraries
  available in almost every programming language in order to connect a program in
  the language to an HTTP service.  '
