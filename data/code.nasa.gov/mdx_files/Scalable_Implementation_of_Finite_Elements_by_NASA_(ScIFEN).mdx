description: The Scalable Implementation of Finite Elements by NASA (ScIFEN) package
  is a parallel finite element analysis code written in C&#43;&#43;. It is designed
  to enable scalable solutions to computational mechanics problems by leveraging several
  open-source high performance computing libraries for numerical linear algebra routines
  and parallel input/output. ScIFEN supports several different finite element types,
  nonlinear material models, and boundary conditions and contains both implicit and
  explicit time integration procedures called ScIFEi and ScIFEx, respectively.
