description: This technology disclosure is for the Enhanced Testability Analysis (ETA)
  Tool V8.0. The version of the ETA Tool is an upgrade of the previous reported ETA
  Tool (LEW-18795-1). This technology is a NASA Glenn-developed software application
  that supports fault management (FM) by performing testability analyses on the fault
  propagation model of a given system. The Extended Testability Analysis (ETA) Tool
  processes a diagnostic model developed from a commercial software package called
  TEAMS Designer using a defined set of modeling conventiuons and practices. ETA Tool
  can provide an assessment of the modeled system based on diagnostic metrics of detectability
  and failure isolation. The program can provide assessment of a system's detection
  coverage, test utilization, failure isolation at the root cause or at the component
  levels, generate a FMEA Report, perform sensor sensitivity studies and provide a
  trace-mapping of failure modes to higher level system effects. ETA Tool generates
  reports from each selected analysis option in both an HTML and XML format to enable
  user access in either standard web browsers or loadable into an Microsoft Excel
  workbook for review/editing.
