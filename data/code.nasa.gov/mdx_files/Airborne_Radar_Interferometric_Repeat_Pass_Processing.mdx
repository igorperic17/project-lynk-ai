description: 'This code is integral to generating products for the currently active
  UAVSAR sensor/program. Repeat pass radar interferometry is integral to current geophysical
  research as it provides the only technique possible of obtaining highly accurate
  (millimeter level) and spatially dense surface deformation measurements. This technique
  is integral to the planned DESDynI mission that will employ L-band repeat pass radar
  interferometry to make surface deformation measurements over all the tectonically
  active regions of the earth surface. '
