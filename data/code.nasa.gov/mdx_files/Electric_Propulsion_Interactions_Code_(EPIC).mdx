description: 'EPIC is an interactive computer toolset that enables the construction
  of a 3D spacecraft model and the assessment of a variety of interactions between
  the model''s subsystems and the plume from an electric thruster. EPIC unites different
  computer tools to address the many complexities associated with spacecraft/plume
  interaction processes. '
