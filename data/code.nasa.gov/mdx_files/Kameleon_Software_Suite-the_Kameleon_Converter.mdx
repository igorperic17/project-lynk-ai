description: Developed at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC), the Kameleon
  Software Suite addresses the difficulty in analyzing and disseminating the varying
  output formats of space weather model data. Employing a comprehensive standardization
  methodology, Kameleon allows heterogeneous model output to be stored uniformly in
  a common science data format. The converted files contain both the original model
  output as well as additional metadata elements to create platform-independent and
  self-descriptive data files. Kameleon facilitates model data dissemination, data
  reuse, and code reuse.
