description: 'When performing mission analysis and design of an imaging system in
  orbit around the earth, answering the fundamental question of imaging performance
  requires an understanding of the image products that will be produced by the imaging
  system. At the highest level, this understanding can be gained by a first principles
  analysis of the geometric image projections involved in image capture from space.
  Additionally, by basing the tools purely on first principles and utilizing a high
  degree of generalization, the same set of tools can be applied to imaging systems
  not in orbit (i.e. helicoptors, high altitude planes, etc). '
