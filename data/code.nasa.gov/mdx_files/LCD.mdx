description: The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the study time
  period is calculated and then compared to the maximum and minimum NDVI from a baseline
  range of years in order to calculate Relative Greenness (RG). The change in RG from
  the previous year is found, and this allows the user to identify abrupt change in
  vegetation.
