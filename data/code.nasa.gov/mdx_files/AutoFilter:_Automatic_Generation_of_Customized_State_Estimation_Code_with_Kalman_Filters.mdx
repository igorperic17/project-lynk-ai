description: AutoFilter is a software tool that automatically generates efficient
  and customized code for navigation and state estimation using Kalman filter algorithms.
  The input for the tool is a detailed, high-level description of the problem's process,
  noise, and measurement models as well as software interface descriptions and architectural
  details. Using its powerful symbolic system and algorithms schemas, AutoFilter symbolically
  calculates all required matrices and produces code tailored toward the specific
  problem.
