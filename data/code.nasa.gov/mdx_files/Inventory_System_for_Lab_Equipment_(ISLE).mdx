description: This web application allows inventories of assets to be managed. Assets
  along with their specifications are added to the system and then used by users via
  a check-in/check-out function. The inventory can be browsed by category or using
  search. Users are given various roles within the system to allow them to perform
  certain functions such as view-only, check-in/check-out, modify, and full-control.
  Inventory managers can add and track detailed information on all inventory assets
  including manufacturer, storage location, custom attributes, and relationships with
  other assets. Assets can be found by browsing by category, search, location, or
  current user. Assets are checked out to specified locations by users.
