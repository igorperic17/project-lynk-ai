description: 'This software is currently being used by the Phoenix mission for landing
  site selection. So far 39 HiRISE imagery (> 28 GB) covering one sigma landing ellipse
  of the three primary landing sites have been processed and their rock distribution
  maps have been produced. Over 10 million hazard rocks have been detected and mapped.
  Without this system, it would be impossible to produce such maps to meet the landing
  site certification review deadline. This technology is also applicable to the Mars
  Science Laboratory (MSL) Mission as well as to any future surface missions. '
