description: Software implementation of JPL published paper for performing lossless
  hyper-spectral and milti-spectral data compression. The implementation was executed
  to confirm the results obtained by JPL independently. Implemented JPL published
  paper and its revised version presented to the CCSDS hyper/multi-spectral data compression
  working group. The implementation follows every step listed in the relevant papers
  and usess C-code for simplicity. The software takes 3-dimensional test data provided
  by the CCSDS working group and created predictor error results that can be further
  encoded with other known techniques.
