description: 'The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) IV&V Simulation and Test (JIST)
  Solid State Recorder (SSR) Simulator is a component of the JIST system and is responsible
  for simulating basic SSR functionality.  The primary purpose of the SSR Simulator
  is to assist in performing independent verfication and validation (IV&V) of the
  flight software.  The SSR simulator is a software-only simulator that provides the
  necessary interface to the JWST flight software and typically simulates SSR management
  functions.  Specific functions include playback, record, and normal telemetry transmission.  The
  SSR simulator is also equipped with many different configurations that can be initialized
  using command line arguments. The SSR Simulator has reuse potential on future missions
  that utilize a Solid State Recorder.  '
