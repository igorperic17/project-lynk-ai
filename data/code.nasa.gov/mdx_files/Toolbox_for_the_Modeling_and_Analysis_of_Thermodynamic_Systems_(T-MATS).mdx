description: 'T-MATS is open source software code. The Toolbox for the Modeling and
  Analysis of Thermodynamic Systems (T-MATS) is a Simulink toolbox intended for use
  in the modeling and simulation of thermodynamic systems and their controls. T-MATS
  contains generic thermodynamic and controls components that may be combined with
  a variable input iterative solver and optimization algorithm to create complex systems
  to meet the needs of a developer. Developement of this tool was completed on behalf
  of the NASA Aviation Safety Program''s Vehicle Systems Safety Technologies (VSST)
  project located at the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, OH. '
