description: In the KATS application, a method of abstraction was used to in a foundational
  website platform that liberated the developers from the concern of having to manually
  generate Entity Framework calls to interact with the data layer of the application.  This
  abstraction method/layer provided the ground work from which was developed a "Project
  Foundation" that has now become the basic starting block for all of our web-based
  solution development.  This foundation drastically reduces project "spin up" time
  and standardizes data layer and other service interactions to ensure consistently
  high performing transactional solutions.
