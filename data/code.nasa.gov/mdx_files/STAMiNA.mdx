description: 'Utilizing STAMiNA, a simulation tool for the Advanced Sensors Collaborative
  Technology Alliance Microsensor Network Architecture, users can define: (1) mission
  environment, including terrain features; (2) a sensed object set, including multiple
  threat objects; (3) sensor placements, their modalities, and their abilities to
  sense different object types; (4) threat object trajectories; (5) sensing and sensed
  data dissemination for information fusion; and (6) various network configurations
  and formations between sensors to examine the coupling of sensing and communication.
  With these features, STAMiNA provides an overall system-level performance of different
  sensor network architectures under different parametric conditions.'
