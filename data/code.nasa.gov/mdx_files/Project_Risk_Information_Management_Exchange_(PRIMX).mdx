description: The Project Risk Information Management Exchange (PRIMX) provides a centralized
  source for continuous risk management (CRM) information by combining risk identification,
  analysis, planning, tracking, control, and communication into a single comprehensive
  environment that meets the requirements of NASA Procedures and Guidelines (NPG)
  7120.5B and 8000.4. The software permits project personnel access to current CRM
  documentation, gives the status of risk activities, and identifies emerging risks
  that may influence the formulation development of a given project/program. PRIMX
  is free-standing network software (not an add-on program) that runs on any Windows
  platform.
