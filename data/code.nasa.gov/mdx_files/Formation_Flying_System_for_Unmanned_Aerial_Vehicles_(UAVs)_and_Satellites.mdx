description: Using a distributed mesh network communication architecture, this system
  facilitates formation flying by providing a framework for the exchange of information
  among multiple vehicles. By exchanging pertinent data, various vehicles can perform
  as a single formation deployment shape without direct control from the ground.  The
  technology's generic design affords applicability to to an array of vehicle types,
  including UAVs and satellites.
