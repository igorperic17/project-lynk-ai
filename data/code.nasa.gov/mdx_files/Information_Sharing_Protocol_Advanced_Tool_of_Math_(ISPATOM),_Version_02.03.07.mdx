description: ISPATOM is a generic computational software program (comps). Most comps
  that are run in the NASA Mission Control Center (MCC) must be defined and hard-coded
  into C or some other programming language. ISPATOM runs on the MCC Linux workstations
  and can run any computations that can be represented as a mathematical equation
  without prior configuration. An equation or several equations are simply entered
  on the command line, the values are calculated, the computed values are saved in
  output symbols, and the output symbols are published.
