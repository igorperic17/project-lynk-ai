description: 'OpenMDAO version 0.1 is the initial version of the next generation Multidisciplinary
  Design Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) open source framework.   OpenMDAO is the
  open source framework developed by NASA that will be accessible via an open source
  website to reach the entire broad based MDAO community to facilitate advancing the
  science of MDAO.  MDAO covers a vast set of capabilities, including a flexible framework
  and state of the art discipline codes.  This innovation relates specifically to
  the framework.  OpenMDAO provides the core software infrastructure to integrate
  multidisciplinary variable fidelity tools and enable design, analysis, and optimization
  of complex systems.  Currently, the OpenMDAO version 0.1 functionalities include
  component linking, data passing, driver interface, and lazy evaluation.  This initial
  basic capability of the framework is sufficient for users to run and optimize their
  analysis after they integrate their specific component codes.  As OpenMDAO evolves,
  the following capabilities will be included in the framework:  interprocess communications,
  error handling, user interfaces, geometry application program interfaces (APIs),
  plug-in interfaces, utilities to wrap tools, versioning, and parallel processing
  support.  To be clear, the framework will enable the integration of, but will not
  include: optimizers, solvers, visualization tools, custom data types, script components,
  and discipline codes.  AEROSPACE:  To meet the present and future economic and environmental
  challenges facing air transportation, aviation design must expand its focus from
  today''s conventional "wing-body-tail" aircraft to more advanced vehicles.   The
  ability to design revolutionary aircraft to improve mobility and air transport efficiency
  is of paramount importance to the national economy, along with reducing our environmental
  impact and supporting national defense.   Technologies such as the one disclosed
  here incorporate progressively more sophisticated computational models and methods,
  enabling future aircraft designs today.'
