description: 'TFaNS predicts tone noise emanating from a fan stage, including the
  effects of reflection and transmission by the rotor and stator and by the duct inlet
  and nozzle. Version 1.5 upgrades include: the SOURCE3D subprogram''s ability to
  perform transmission-loss calculation for modes scattering into themselves; the
  inlet and aft radiation codes'' use of infinite envelope elements in the far-field;
  and the AWAKEN subprogram''s use of a new Acoustic Wake/Turbulence File format.'
