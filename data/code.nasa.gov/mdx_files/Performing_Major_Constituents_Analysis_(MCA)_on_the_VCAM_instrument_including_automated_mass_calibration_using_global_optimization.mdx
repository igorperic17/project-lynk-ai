description: Vehicle Cabin Atmosphere Monitor (VCAM) can provide a means for monitoring
  the air within the enclosed environments, such as the ISS, Crew Exploration Vehicle
  (CEV), a Lunar Habitat, or another vehicle traveling to Mars. Its miniature preconcentrator,
  gas chromatograph (GC), and mass spectrometer can provide unbiased detection of
  a large number of organic species. VCAM's software can identify whether the chemicals
  are on a targeted list of hazardous compounds and their concentration.
