description: 'This software should be applicable to any aerial array of cameras. The
  algorithm assumes that features found in the imagery are at infinity, so it is not
  well suited to ground applications. This software fits into a larger program developed
  by the customer. That program collects synchronized images from an array of cameras
  mounted in parallel on a gimballed frame attached to an aircraft. In addition GPS
  and IMU data is collected to allow the images to be registered to ground locations.
  The aircraft circles over an area of interest. Synchronized images are captured
  from each camera in the array and are stitched togehter into a single very high
  resolution image is is projected onto an elevation map of the ground. '
