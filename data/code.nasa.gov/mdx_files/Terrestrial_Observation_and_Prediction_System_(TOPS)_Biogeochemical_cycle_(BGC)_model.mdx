description: 'The Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS) is a modeling
  software that integrates data from satellites, weather stations, climate models
  with ecosystem models to produce nowcasts and forecasts of ecological conditions.
  The key tools used in producing the nowcasts and forecasts are simulation models
  including biogeochemical and ecosystem models that estimate the states (vegetation
  leaf area, biomass, soil moisture, snow, etc.) and functions (evapotranspiration,
  photosynthesis, etc.) of various kinds of plant canopies (forests, crops, grass,
  shrubs). These ecological nowcasts and forecasts are akin to current and forecast
  weather conditions. Upon further refinement and testing, the ecological nowcasts
  and forecasts are useful for making a variety of management decisions such as irrigation
  scheduling, timing of field operations, preparing for floods/droughts, vector-borne
  diseases, crop phenology and production.  '
