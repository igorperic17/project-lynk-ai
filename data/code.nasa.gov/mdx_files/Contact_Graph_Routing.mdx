description: "This software was developed to support the NASA DTN Technology Readiness\
  \ program. The Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) communication system is an implementation\
  \ of Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocols for space flight operations. It enables\
  \ reliable automatic data communication over a network of arbitrarily complex topology\
  \ comprising both deep-space links and more Internet-like connections. \r\n"
