description: 'Aerial water detection is important for tracking changes in water boundaries
  that occur when the water elevation changes. From an aerial platform (manned or
  unmanned), new terrestrial water bodies could be automatically detected at far range
  and added to a database. Water bodies that no longer exist (such as a dried up pond)
  could be automatically detected and removed from a database. In addition, drastic
  changes in a water detection region could be detected, potentially indicating an
  environmental crisis such as an oil spill. '
