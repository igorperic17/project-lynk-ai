description: The EOS MLS Level 2 software uses the algorithm described in the 'MLS
  Retrieval processes Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document.' The software to implement
  the algorithm has been written in the Fortran 95 programming language, chosen because
  of its great suitability to handling the complex matrix and vector entities involved.
  Combining both the retrieval and simulation tasks in a single piece of software
  makes it far easier to ensure that identical forward model algorithms and parameters
  are used in both tasks and dramatically reduces the complexity of the code maintenance
  effort. The unique features of this software lies with the instrument and its unique
  capabilities to measure the atmospheric temperatures and composition at the earth's
  limb.
