description: Innovators at NASA's Johnson Space Center have developed software that
  is an easy-to-use implementation of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method
  that can be applied to a broad base of low-density flow problems. Its built-in flexibility,
  automation, and intuitiveness, combined with the potential of its parallel processing
  capabilities, provides an easy-to-use, high-performance solution for analyzing rarefied
  flows.
