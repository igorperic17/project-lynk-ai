description: This toolkit will read geolocated brightness temperature data (in ASCII
  format) from any flight of the AMPR airborne instrument.  A python script will pull
  out timing, brightness temperatures, and other information  from each channel/geolocation
  and store them as attributes using the appropriate type of numpy array. The approach
  consists of ingesting the entire file as a text string and then parsing and converting
  as necessary. The file is read and the data are populated when the class is instantiated
  with the full path and name of an AMPR file. Numerous visualization methods are
  provided, including track plots, strip charts, and Google Earth KMZs. In addition,
  polarization deconvolution is available.
