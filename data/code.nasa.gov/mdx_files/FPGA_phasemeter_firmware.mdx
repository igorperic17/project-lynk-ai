description: 'The phasemeter is an important part of a laser metrology system for
  measuring absolute distances. This software is used to build a precision structure,
  like a really big telescope, which would deploy in space. Since lightweight deployment
  mechanisms aren''t accurate enough for high-resolution optical telescopes, the laser
  metrology system measure distances on the deployed structure. The phasemeter is
  the stage of the metrology system that laser relative phases into distance measurements,
  which are used to actively control the structure with sub-micron accuracy. '
