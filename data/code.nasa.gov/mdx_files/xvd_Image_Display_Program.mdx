description: 'xvd, short for "X-windows VICAR Display", is an image display program
  for VICAR and PDS images. It is designed to efficiently display large (multiple
  GB) images, and includes several basic image processing functions. It has been the
  de-facto standard image display program used within the NASA JPL Multimission Image
  Processing Lab (MIPL) since 1995. It runs on Unix systems (Solaris, Linux, Mac OS
  X) that have X-windows, and works well over remote X-window connections. '
