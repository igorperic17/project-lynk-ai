description: 'S4PM is a set of Perl scripts that implement a data-driven processing
  system that executes science algorithms automatically as new data arrive. S4PM includes
  a graphical user interface for monitoring algorithms and the overall system for
  failures. The Perl scripts can currently process data from the Moderate Resolution
  Imaging Spectroradiometer and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder, but the technology
  can be extended to process data from other missions if desired. Please visit the
