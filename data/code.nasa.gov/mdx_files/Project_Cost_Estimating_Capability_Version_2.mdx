description: Used to develop cost estimates/models for space systems, this technology
  combines an Excel add-in with a simple, robust, and transparent collection of NASA
  cost-estimating relationships (CERs), statistics, work breakdown structures, and
  cost-estimating algorithms. The approach's use of native Excel functionality to
  provide basic calculations limits the overhead required to maintain a model and
  affords more visibility to the user with regard to the calculations and equations
  involved in generating an estimate.
