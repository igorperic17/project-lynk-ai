description: 'SITH was also the only available program to display the color stereo
  images that were produced for Phoenix. It is expected that SITH will be used even
  more for MSL, and future stereo-based missions. As image pipeline parameters are
  tuned before the mission to balance correlation performance vs. accuracy, a tool
  such as this will be invaluable. '
