description: 'The Autonomous Exploration for Gathering Increased Science System (AEGIS)
  provides automated targeting for remote sensing instruments on the Mars Exploration
  Rover (MER) mission, which currently has two rovers exploring the surface of Mars.
  AEGIS enables the rover flight software to analyze imagery onboard in order to autonomously
  select and sequence targeted remote-sensing observations in an opportunistic fashion. '
