description: "The Bundle Protocol (BP) is an international standard produced by the\
  \ Consultative Committee for Space Data Standards (CCSDS).  It is a key piece of\
  \ the planned Interplanetary Internet.  The basic idea is that BP is given bundles\
  \ to deliver, and it delivers them to their specified destination, using the appropriate\
  \ route.  For example, the route might be from a Mars Rover to a Mars Orbiter to\
  \ a Ground Station on Earth to a Mission Control Center.  For each hop along the\
  \ way, BP asks for assistance from the appropriate lower-level protocol.  For example,\
  \ to move bundles from a Ground Station to a Mission Control Center, it might use\
  \ the Transmission Control Protocol (tcp).  Generally, the lower-level protocol\
  \ is responsible for providing reliable delivery across one hop, while BP manages\
  \ the bigger picture (i.e. getting bundles across all the required hops).\r\n\r\n\
  The Bundle Protocol Software Library implements the Bundle Protocol, using a software\
  \ architecture that is simple and fast enough to be attractive to Goddard mission\
  \ designers.   It has been developed for the Laser Communication Relay Demonstration\
  \ (LCRD) mission and the Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) group.  It is useful\
  \ for any organization (commercial or otherwise) that is interested in being part\
  \ of the Interplanetary Internet."
