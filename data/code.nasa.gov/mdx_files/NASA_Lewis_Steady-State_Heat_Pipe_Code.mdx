description: "The NASA Lewis Research Center Heat Pipe (LERCHP) code was developed\
  \ to predict the performance of heat pipes in the steady state.  LERCHP can be used\
  \ as a design tool on a personal computer or, with a suitable calling routine, as\
  \ a subroutine for a mainframe radiator code.  For accurate heat pipe modeling,\
  \ a variety of wick structures are available to the user, including a user wick\
  \ input option.  Several working fluids can be chosen as well, including potassium,\
  \ sodium, and lithium, for which the monomer-dimer equilibrium is considered.  A\
  \ vapor flow algorithm is incorporated that treats compressibility and axially varying\
  \ heat input.  LERCHP also facilitates the determination of heat pipe operating\
  \ temperatures and heat pipe limits that may be encountered at the specified heat\
  \ input and environment temperature.\r\n\r\n"
