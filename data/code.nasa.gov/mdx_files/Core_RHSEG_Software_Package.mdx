description: The RHSEG software provides hierarchical segmentation (pre-processing)
  of image and image-like data. The software significantly improves the extraction
  of patterns from complex data sets and is optimized for speed and accuracy. This
  algorithm provides the user with precise control for selecting the desired level
  of detail from the hierarchy of results.
