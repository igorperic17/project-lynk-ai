description: Developed for the Constellation program, Jitter Controller Software helps
  manage the relationships between phase jitter crest factor, frequency jitter crest
  factor, and cycle-to-cycle crest factor. Written in LabVIEW, the code calls Agilent
  drivers to write to generator hardware. Although not well documented and originally
  intended to be disposable, the software has been reused.
