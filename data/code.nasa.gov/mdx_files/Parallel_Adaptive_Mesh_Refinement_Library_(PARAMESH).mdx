description: PARAMESH offers parallel support with adaptive mesh capability for a
  large class of models on distributed memory machines. This package of Fortran 90
  subroutines provides an application developer with an easy route to extend an existing
  serial code using a logically Cartesian structured mesh into a parallel code with
  adaptive mesh refinement.
