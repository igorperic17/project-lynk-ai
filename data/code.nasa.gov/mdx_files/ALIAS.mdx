description: "The Advanced Land Image Assessment Systems (ALIAS) supports radiometric\
  \ and geometric image processing for the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) instrument on\
  \ board NASA\u2019s Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite. ALIAS consists of two processing\
  \ subsystems for radiometric and geometric processing of the ALI\u2019s multispectral\
  \ imagery. The radiometric processing subsystem characterizes and corrects, where\
  \ possible, radiometric qualities including: detector operability; gain; bias; coherent,\
  \ impulse and random noise; signal-to-noise ratios (SNR); saturation levels; striping\
  \ and banding; and the stability of detector performance. The geometric processing\
  \ subsystem and analysis capabilities support sensor alignment calibrations; sensor\
  \ chip assembly (SCA)-to-SCA alignments and related issues; geodetic accuracy assessments;\
  \ modulation transfer function (MTF) characterizations; and perform image-to-image\
  \ characterizations. The ALIAS also characterizes and corrects band-to-band registration,\
  \ and performs systematic, precision and terrain correction of ALI images. The ALIAS\
  \ can geometrically correct and automatically mosaic the SCA image strips into a\
  \ seamless, map-projected image. The ALIAS was developed through collaboration between\
  \ NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)."
