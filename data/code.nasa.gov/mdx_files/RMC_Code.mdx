description: The RMC code computes radiation from solid rocket motor flow fields.
  Each receiver specified in the surface input is selected in sequence. Radiation
  is computed for each spectral interval requested, and radiation results are summed
  for output. The computation for each spectral band begins with conversion of plume
  properties to optical properties for that band; rays from the receiver surface are
  generated in random directions to intersect the plume.
