description: The Spatial Standard Observer (SSO) is a computer program for measurement
  and specification of the perceptual intensity of a visual image, or of the perceptual
  distance between two visual images. The SSO operates on a digital image or a pair
  of digital images. It computes a numerical measure of the perceptual strength of
  the single image, or of the difference between the images.
