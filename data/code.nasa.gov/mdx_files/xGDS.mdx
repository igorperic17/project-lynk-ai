description: xGDS (Exploration Ground Data Systems) synthesizes real world data (from
  sensors, robots, ROVs, mobile devices, etc) and human observations into rich, digital
  maps and displays for analysis, decision making, and collaboration. xGDS evolved
  from our work developing tools to control, monitor and collect data from autonomous
  rovers supporting NASA's terrestrial field science research. xGDS is a highly collaborative,
  interactive suite of web software.
