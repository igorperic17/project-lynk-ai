description: This set of MATLAB functions has been used to generate state data (position
  and velocity) for the Sun, the Earth's moon, and all of the other planets in the
  solar system. Provided by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Solar System Dynamics
  Group, the technology uses Chebychev polynomial fits of numerical integration results
  for solar system motion. Essentially, the toolbox functions as the MATLAB equivalent
  of JPL Fortran routines used to construct binary ephemeris files, verify correct
  installation, and generate state data.
