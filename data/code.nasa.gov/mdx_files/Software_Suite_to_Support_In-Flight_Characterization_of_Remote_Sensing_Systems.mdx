description: "A software suite, developed to support NASAs in-flight characterization\
  \ of commercial remote sensing systems, efficiently automates reproducible processing\
  \ of ground truth data.  It is unique in that it takes input from a number of disparate\
  \ data sources, condenses and rapidly processes it, to a form useable by the characterization\
  \ process. It has been largely automated to reduce operator error as much as possible\r\
  \nWritten and developed in the MATLAB programming environment, the characterization\
  \ suite consists of radiometric, geometric and spatial scripts that require knowledge\
  \ of MODTRAN and expertise to run. Each type of characterization relies on knowledge\
  \ of ground characteristics, or ground truth, some of which must be acquired at\
  \ the time of sensor overpass.  Examples of ground truth data include target reflectance,\
  \ incident solar irradiance, atmospheric pressure and water vapor, aerosol content,\
  \ and target location. All of these data sets must be processed in order to be used\
  \ for in-flight characterization.\r\nPreviously used to perform radiometric, geometric,\
  \ and spatial characterization on the IKONOS, QuickBird, OrbView-3, and AWiFS satellite\
  \ sensors.\r\n"
