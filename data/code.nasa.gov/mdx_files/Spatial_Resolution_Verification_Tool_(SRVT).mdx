description: "An automated Spatial Resolution Verification Tool (SRVT) was developed\
  \ to rapidly determine the spatial resolution characteristics of remotely sensed\
  \ aerial and satellite imagery. Most current methods for assessing spatial resolution\
  \ characteristics of imagery rely on pre-deployed engineered targets and are performed\
  \ only at selected times within pre-selected scenes. The SRVT addresses these insufficiencies\
  \ by finding uniform, high-contrast edges from urban scenes and then using these\
  \ edges to determine standard estimators of spatial resolution, such as the modulation\
  \ transfer function (MTF) and the relative edge response (RER).\r\n\r\nDeveloped\
  \ using the MATLAB programming language and environment, this automated software\
  \ algorithm assesses every image in an acquired data set, using edges found within\
  \ each image, and in many cases eliminating the need for dedicated edge targets.\
  \ SRVT automatically identifies  high-contrast, uniform edges and calculates the\
  \ MTF and RER of each image, and when possible, within sections of an image, so\
  \ that the variation of spatial resolution characteristics across the image can\
  \ be analyzed. The automated algorithm is capable of quickly verifying the spatial\
  \ resolution quality of all images within a data set, enabling the appropriate use\
  \ of those images in a number of applications.\r\nThe SRVT has been validated against\
  \ traditional techniques using IKONOS and QuickBird satellite imagery."
