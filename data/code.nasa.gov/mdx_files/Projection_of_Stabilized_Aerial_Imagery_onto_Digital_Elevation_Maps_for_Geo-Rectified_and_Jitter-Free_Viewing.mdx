description: The code developed finds a mapping from points on the ground (DEM) to
  pixels in the image. By performing this process for all points on the ground one
  can "paint" the ground with the image, effectively performing a projection of the
  image onto the ground. In order to make this processes efficient we developed a
  method for finding a region of interest (ROI) on the ground where the image will
  project to.
