description: 'This software would be considered generally valuable to both manned
  and unmanned science gathering programs. Because policy statements can be domain
  independent this software can equally be applied to a vast variety of different
  applications. PBEM is a rules-based approach to enterprise management that can be
  used to automate certain management tasks. PBEM simplifies the management of a given
  endeavor by establishing policies to deal with situations that are likely to occur.
  Policies are operating rules that can be referred to as a means of maintaining order,
  security, consistency, or other ways of successfully furthering a goal or mission.
  PBEM provides a way of managing configuration of network elements, applications
  and processes via a set of high-level rules or business policies rather than managing
  individual elements. '
