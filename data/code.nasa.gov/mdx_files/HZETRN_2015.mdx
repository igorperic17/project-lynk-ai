description: HZETRN2015 is the latest update of the HZETRN deterministic space radiation
  transport code. HZETRN2015 contains new algorithms and options for calculating three
  dimensional transport in user-defined combinatorial or ray-trace geometry. More
  computationally efficient bi-directional transport algorithms, similar to those
  found in HZETRN2010, may also be used to perform transport through multilayer slabs,
  or users can opt to create an interpolation database for various thicknesses within
  one to three user-defined material layers using a straight-ahead transport algorithm,
  similar to HZETRN2005. Transport calculations may be executed for Galactic Cosmic
  Ray (GCR), Solar Particle Event (SPE), Low Earth Orbit (LEO), and user-defined environment
  boundary conditions. Neutrons, protons, and light ions are transported for SPE and
  LEO boundary conditions, while for GCR boundary conditions, heavy ions, pions, muons,
  electrons, positrons, and photons are also transported.
