description: "Tool for Turbine Engine Closed-loop Transient Analysis (TTECTrA)\r\n\
  \r\nThe Tool for Turbine Engine Closed-loop Transient Analysis (TTECTrA) is a tool,\
  \ developed in the Mathworks(R) Matlab/Simulink enviornment, intended to extend\
  \ systems analysis by providing an estimate of the transient performance/capability\
  \ of a conceptual engine design.  The TTECTrA tool is capable of designing a basic\
  \ turbofan engine controller, with transient protection, based on the user's engine\
  \ model and constraints.  TTECTrA is built in the Mathworks Matlab/Simulink environment\
  \ and relies on the Matlab Control Systems Toolbox to provide additional functionality\
  \ and streamline the control design process."
