description: This software models the Delay Tolerant Networking - Licklider Transmision
  Protocol for JPL's MACHETE (Multimission Advanced Communications Hybrid Environment
  for Test and Evaluation). The Multi-mission Advanced Communications Hybrid Environment
  for Test and Evaluation (MACHETE) has been developed at JPL for the purpose of determining
  the performance of existing and emerging communications protocols and services in
  the context of space exploration. This protocol model can assist NASA network designers
  who wish to use Delay Tolerant Networking protocols.
