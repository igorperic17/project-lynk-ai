description: 'This tool is used to perform the scientific analysis of the MIRO measurements
  and to study the evolution of the comet coma. The scientific analysis contributes
  to one of NASAs research objectives: Learn how the Suns family of planets and minor
  bodies originated and evolved. A lightweight, un-cooled dual-frequency heterodyne
  radiometer has been developed for the European Space Agency (ESA) Rosetta mission
  to Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with encounters at Earth, Mars, and two asteroid
  (2867) Steins and (21) Lutetia. '
