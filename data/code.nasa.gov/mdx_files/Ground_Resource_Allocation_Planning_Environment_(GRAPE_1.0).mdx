description: DSN antennas are used to track most of NASA and foreign partners deep
  space missions. Efficient team collaboration in the DSN utilization planning phase
  ensures the efficient use of the antennas, thus reducing the cost of DSN operations.
  Team collaboration during planning is also expected to reduce space flight mission
  costs by reducing the overhead associated with the DSN resource allocation process
  and by lowering antenna negotiation time and schedule rework required. GRAPE provides
  a team collaboration environment where all documents, team knowledge, and applications
  come to a single access point.
