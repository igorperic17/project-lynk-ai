description: 'This toolkit is a set of MATLAB scripts and functions that enable rapid
  transfer of optical system and performance data from Code V optical software into
  the MATLAB environment. Typical applications include: extracting prescription data
  into MATLAB to confirm consistency of various delivered models; perturbing the models
  and performing various analyses such as ray tracing or generation of point-spread
  functions in support of integrated modeling activities; and enabling a MATLAB-driven
  optical model for integrated system-level modeling of wavefront sensing and control.
  The toolkit can be downloaded at: http://opensource.gsfc.nasa.gov/projects/Matlab_Code_V/index.php'
