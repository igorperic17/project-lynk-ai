description: MMM-Py reads, analyzes, and displays three-dimensional national mosaicked
  reflectivity data produced by NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL). MMM-Py
  can read MRMS mosaics from either their unique binary format or their converted
  NetCDF format; it can also read and properly interpret the current mosaic design
  (4 regional tiles) as well as mosaics produced prior to late July 2013 (8 tiles).
  The technology can easily stitch multiple tiles together to provide a larger regional
  or national picture of precipitating weather systems. Composites, horizontal/vertical
  cross-sections, and combinations thereof are easily displayed using as little as
  one line of code.
