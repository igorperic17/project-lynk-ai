description: 'AXOD computes the flow and efficiency of multistage axial-flow turbines
  as functions of speed and pressure ratio. The technology uses a span-line analysis
  with simple radial equilibrium. The loss model includes blade-row inlet losses,
  blade-row losses, and stage-test losses. Coefficients are selected to match the
  known design-point performance, and the internal model provides the off-design performance. '
