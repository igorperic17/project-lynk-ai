description: CBAero is a software tool for the prediction of the conceptual aero-thermodynamic
  environments of aerospace configurations. The vehicle geometry is defined using
  unstructured, triangulated surface meshes. For subsonic Mach numbers a fast, unstructured,
  multi-pole panel code is coupled with a streamline tracing formulation to define
  the viscous surface solution. For supersonic and hypersonic Mach numbers, various
  independent panel methods are coupled with the streamline tracing formulation, attachment
  line detection methods, and stagnation-attachment line heating models to define
  the viscous aero-thermal environment.
