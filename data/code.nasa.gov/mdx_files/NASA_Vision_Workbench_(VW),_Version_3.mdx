description: 'Vision Workbench (VW) is a modular, extensible computer vision framework
  that supports a range of tasks, including automated science and engineering analysis,
  large satellite image processing, and 2D/3D environment reconstruction. The framework
  provides a rapid C++ development environment as well as a flexible, multi-platform
  system to deploy computer vision applications. The module interface allows new capabilities
  to be rapidly integrated, and the dataflow architecture allows image-processing
  pipelines to be quickly developed and reconfigured. '
