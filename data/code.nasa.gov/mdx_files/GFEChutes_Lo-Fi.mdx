description: "The GFE Lo-Fi Chutes Model provides basic modeling capability of a sequential\
  \ series of parachute activities.  Actions include deploying the parachute, changing\
  \ the reefing on the parachute, and cutting away the parachute.  Multiple chutes\
  \ can be deployed at any given time, but all chutes in that case are assumed to\
  \ behave as individually isolated chutes; there is no modeling of any interactions\
  \ between deployed chutes.  Drag characteristics of a deployed chute are based on\
  \ a coefficient of drag, the face-area of the chute, and the local dynamic pressure\
  \ only.  The orientation of the chute is approximately modeled for purposes of obtaining\
  \ torques on the vehicle, but the dynamic state of the chute as a separate entity\
  \ is not integrated, the treatment is simply an approximation. \r\n\r\nPlans for\
  \ every post-shuttle manned vehicle which will reenter Earth's atmosphere, or for\
  \ that matter, the Martian atmosphere, include a descent phase controlled by some\
  \ sort of parachute system.  Having a NASA-certified parachute model which can be\
  \ plugged into various flight simulators is a huge advantage.  Building a special\
  \ purpose parachute simulator for a specific simulation is at least a million dollar\
  \ job.  Lockheed Martin had to do exactly that in order to support Pad Abort I,\
  \ and GFEChutes Lo-Fi was tested against the Lockheed prototype.  \r\n\r\nHaving\
  \ a verified, Class C parachute model, packaged in a reusable (plug-and-play) form,\
  \ is smart technically and an outstanding strategic move as we enter the world of\
  \ commercial manned space flight. "
