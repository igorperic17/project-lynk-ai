description: This software framework automates the generation of flight dynamics products
  by providing a unified and consistent graphical interface to various tools. The
  technology coordinates the execution of applications such as Satellite ToolKit,
  FreeFlyer, and MATLAB; allows for the embedding of Perl code; provides a mechanism
  for passing messages between a collection of XFDS processes; and allows GMSEC messages
  to be sent and received. Automation configuration is stored in text files and can
  be edited directly or by using graphical editors implemented for each tool.
