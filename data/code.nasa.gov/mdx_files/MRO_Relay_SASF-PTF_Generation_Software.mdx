description: 'This tool will continue to be used by the MRO project to support all
  relay activities with all NASA and non-NASA assets on the surface of Mars. At the
  time of writing, this includes Phoenix and the Mars Exploration Rovers; and will
  likely include Mars Surface Laboratory (2009) and the European ExoMars (expected
  2013). This software utilizes an input file provided by the lander team, along with
  a managed configuration file, to run MRO''s MTT software (described elsewhere) recursively
  to construct the Relay PTF. '
