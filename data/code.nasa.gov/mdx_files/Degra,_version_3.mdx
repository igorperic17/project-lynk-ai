description: 'Degra is relevant to NASA current and future work. Degra is currently
  being used by the Mars Science Laboratory project for prediction of MMRTG performance
  on Mars. In addition Degra is to be used for future SMD missions where RTG power
  generation is applied. Degra is a generalized simulation of the performance and
  degradation of a radioisotope thermoelectric Generator (RTG) over its lifetime.
  It is provided with a graphical user interface (GUI) which is used to edit the input
  parameters which describe the initial state of the RTG and the time-varying loads
  and environment to which it will be exposed. '
