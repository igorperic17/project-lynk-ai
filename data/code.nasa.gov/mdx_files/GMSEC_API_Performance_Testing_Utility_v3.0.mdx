description: "Statistical performance testing tool used to test and measure the GMSEC\
  \ middleware systems by recreatihng test scenarios under various configurations.\
  \ The benchmarks run simulations at increasing loads, measuring the performance\
  \ in terms of message transmission delay. The results can be visually inspected\
  \ in Microsoft Excel graphs, or raw numerical data. The utility features the ability\
  \ to compare performance of middleware based systems against raw TCP socket to socket\
  \ communications, providing a better perspective on the relative worths of the GMSEC\
  \ compliant middleware systems.\r\n"
