description: This sectored one-dimensional model utilizes a simplified computational
  fluid dynamics (CFD) algorithm to simulate combustion and acoustic processes (including
  instabilities) in combustors with complex shapes. Utilizing modest computational
  resources, the code produces realistic results and is well suited for controls development.
