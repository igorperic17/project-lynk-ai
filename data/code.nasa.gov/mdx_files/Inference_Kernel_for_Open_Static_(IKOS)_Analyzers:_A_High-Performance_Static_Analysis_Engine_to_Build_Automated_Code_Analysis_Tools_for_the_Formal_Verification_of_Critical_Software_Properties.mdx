description: 'IKOS is a kernel for the construction of open-static analyzers based
  on Patrick Cousot and Radhia Cousot''s theory of abstract interpretation, which
  states that computations can be abstracted and reduced to a generalized set of objects
  and still exhibit the same critical properties of the parent program. By reducing
  the set of objects through abstraction, IKOS is scalable to large complex computer
  programs and presents a sound approach to verification of such programs. '
