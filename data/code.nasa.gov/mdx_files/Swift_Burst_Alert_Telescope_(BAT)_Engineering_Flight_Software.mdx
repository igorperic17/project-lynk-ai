description: The BAT engineering software controls and coordinates all aspects of
  the instrument's operation in nominal and anomalous conditions. It distributes commands
  to, and collects data from, all instrument subsystems, including the power system,
  the 16 detector blocks, the digital signal processor, and the science data processing
  software. The technology also communicates with the Swift spacecraft to receive
  commands from the ground and send all instrument telemetry data. In addition, the
  software monitors the health of various instrument subsystems and takes corrective
  actions when necessary.
