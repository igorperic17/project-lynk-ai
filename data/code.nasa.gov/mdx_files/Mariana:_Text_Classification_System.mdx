description: 'Mariana is an algorithm that efficiently optimizes the hyperparameters
  for support vector machines for regression and classification. It currently uses
  simulated annealing for optimization but can be extended to use a variety of stochastic
  optimization techniques, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Sequential Monte Carlo,
  and genetic algorithms. '
