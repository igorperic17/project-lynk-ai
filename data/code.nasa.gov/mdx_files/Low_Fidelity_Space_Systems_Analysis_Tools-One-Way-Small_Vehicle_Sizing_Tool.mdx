description: This tool sizes small or one-way/one time use vehicles for propulsive
  manuvers both in and out of atmosphere. The system will provide rough Figure of
  Merit (FOM) estimates of mass, power, volume, and ephemeris/trajectory change capacity,
  and provide a rough breakdown of the intert masses, propulsive masses and payload
  masses. Additionally, the system provides context for the mass breakdown and is
  intended for small vehicles doing one or two manuvers. Small Vehicle Sizing Tool
  uses Microsoft Excel.
