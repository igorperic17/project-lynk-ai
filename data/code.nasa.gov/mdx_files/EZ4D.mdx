description: NASA's ez4d software is a time-accurate three-dimensional Navier-Stokes
  solver for unstructured meshes. The ez4d software framework utilizes generic template
  programming in C++ to allow users to extend the code for simulations of any general
  conservation laws. Shared-memory multi-thread as well as distributed-memory MPI
  paradigms are implemented in ez4d to facilitate efficient large-scale parallel numerical
  simulations.
