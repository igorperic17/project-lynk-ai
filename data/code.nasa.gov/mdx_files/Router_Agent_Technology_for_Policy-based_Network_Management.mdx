description: "This stand-alone application is named 'RouterAgent'. We have currently\
  \ realized a fully functional (version-1) implementation for Windows operating system\
  \ and for CISCO routers; this version is already deployed in real world at APL and\
  \ DISA test sites. We are in the process of realizing the same for Unix/Linux operating\
  \ systems, Juniper routers, as well as, adding more advanced automation features\
  \ to the realized products.\r\n"
