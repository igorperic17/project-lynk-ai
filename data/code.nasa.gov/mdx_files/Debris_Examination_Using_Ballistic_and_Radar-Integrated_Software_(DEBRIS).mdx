description: 'DEBRIS provides the rapid and accurate C-band/X-band radar analysis
  to assess debris-related threats posed to ongoing missions. Jointly developed by
  Johnson Space Center (JSC) and the United States Air Force (USAF), the system is
  composed of two applications: the primary DEBRIS tool, which observes the initial
  150 seconds of a flight, and the Automated Radar Debris Examination Tool (ARDENT),
  which observes the flight time segment between 150 and 480 seconds.'
