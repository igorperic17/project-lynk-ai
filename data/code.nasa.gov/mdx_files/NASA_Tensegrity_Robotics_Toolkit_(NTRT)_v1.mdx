description: "The NASA Tensegrity Robotics Toolkit (NTRT) is a collection of C++ \
  \ and MATLAB software modules for the modeling, simulation, and control of Tensegrity\
  \ Robots.  Tensegrity Robots are a biologically inspired approach to building robots\
  \ based on the tension networks of tensegrity structures, which have no rigid connections\
  \ between elements.  The NTRT was created to enable: the rapid co-exploration of\
  \ structures and controls in a physics based simulation environment; the development\
  \ of tensegrity robotics algorithms such as structural analysis, kinematics, and\
  \ motion planning; and the validation of the algorithms and controls on hardware\
  \ prototypes of the tensegrity robots.\r\n\r\n"
