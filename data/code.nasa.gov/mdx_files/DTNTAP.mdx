description: DTNTAP is a userspace Ethernet driver with the potential to expedite
  DTN deployment by providing a transition mechanism for legacy IP (Internet Protocol)
  applications to run alongside delay and disruption tolerant applications in large
  scale communication networks. By presenting an Ethernet-like interface, DTNTAP gives
  application developers access to many of the benefits of DTN without having to become
  immediately proficient at a new programming API.
