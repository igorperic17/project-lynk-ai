description: "Since the early 1990's, a government/contractor team has developed a\
  \ spacecraft ground system capable of being used for all phases of a spacecraft's\
  \ life: for box-level development and testing, satellite integration and test, and\
  \ post-launch mission operations. This system uses a single, industry-standard protocol,\
  \ to ease integration with other products, and uses both COTS, GOTS and public domain\
  \ software to form a single, cohesive system. It is composed of several parts:\r\
  \n\r\nThe Advanced System for Integration and Spacecraft Testing (ASIST) is the\
  \ user-interface, providing user with the ability to view and analyze telemetry,\
  \ send commands, and automate tests. The Front End Data System reads telemetry from\
  \ spacecrafts, distributing requested data packets to subscribing clients; additionally,\
  \ it controls the forward (command) link to the spacecraft, formatting command packets\
  \ so that the spacecraft can read them and verifying that commands are transferred\
  \ correctly. The Digital History Data Store (DHDS) archives the raw telemetry received\
  \ from the spacecraft and distributes historical telemetry data to clients.\r\n\r\
  \nThis system can be configured in a number of ways. For small labs, a single ASIST\
  \ workstation may be used, while in I&T or mission operations, the configuration\
  \ may include up to 31 ASIST workstations. All configurations provide the user with\
  \ the same standard interface to their flight hardware."
