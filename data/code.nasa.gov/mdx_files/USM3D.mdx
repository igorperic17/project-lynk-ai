description: USM3D is a tetrahedral unstructured flow solver that has become widely
  used in industry, government, and academia for solving aerodynamic problems. Since
  its first introduction in 1989, USM3D has steadily evolved from an inviscid Euler
  solver into a full viscous Navier-Stokes code. The technology has been a part of
  the NASA TetrUSS system.
