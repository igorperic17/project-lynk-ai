description: 'One of the most widely used methods for collecting information about
  an object or phenomenon, in space or on the Earth, which is of scientific interest
  is to capture an image of it. Unfortunately, due to the nature of digital imaging
  hardware, the captured image is a degraded representation of the actual object or
  phenomenon of interest. This software coded in MATLAB, a widely used analysis software
  package, that takes as input any image of an object or phenomenon of scientific
  interest, along with two reference images generated by the same digital imaging
  hardware, applies corrections for the three most prominent sources of image degradation,
  and outputs a corrected image of the object or phenomenon. '
