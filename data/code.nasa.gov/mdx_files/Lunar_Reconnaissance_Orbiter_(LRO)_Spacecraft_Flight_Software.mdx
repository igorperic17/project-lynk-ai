description: LRO Spacecraft Flight Software controls and coordinates all aspects of
  the Orbiter's operation in nominal and anomalous conditions. It distributes commands
  to, and collects data from, all spacecraft subsystems and all seven instruments;
  communicates with the ground controllers in real time to receive commands and send
  housekeeping telemetry data through the S-band RF links; sends science data using
  the class-2 CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP) over the Ka-band RF link; and monitors
  the health of various Orbiter subsystems and takes corrective actions as necessary.
