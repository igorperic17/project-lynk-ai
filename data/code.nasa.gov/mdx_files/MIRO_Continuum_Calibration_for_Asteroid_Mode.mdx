description: 'This software is used to calibrate Microwave Instruments. The software
  determines the relationship between the raw digital unit measured by MIRO and the
  equivalent brightness temperature by analyzing data from calibration frames. The
  found relationship is applied to non-calibration frames which are the measurements
  of an object of interest such as asteroids and other planetary objects that MIRO
  encounters during its operation. This software characterizes the gain fluctuations
  statistically and determines which method to estimate gain between calibration frames. '
