description: The algorithm computes statistically likely combinations of constituents
  based on a set of possible constituent minerals whose abundances are uncertain.   Our
  approach uses a library of source spectra from laboratory experiments or previous
  remote observations.  A superpixel segmentation strategy improves analysis time
  by orders of magnitude, permitting incorporation into an interactive user session.
