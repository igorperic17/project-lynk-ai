description: "Decelerator System Simulation (DSS) is a FORTRAN software tool used\
  \ to predict the motion of a vehicle coupled to a parachute. Separate equations\
  \ of motion for the parachute and vehicle are employed. DSS was modified from an\
  \ existing NASA software program for the Space Shuttle solid rocket booster (SRB)\
  \ recovery system simulation.  Martin Marietta Corp. developed the program, called\
  \ UD233A, for the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. DSS was used to study performance\
  \ of parachute descent of flight test vehicle versions of the NASA Orion space craft.\
  \ DSS incorporates 6 degrees of translational and rotational motion for both the\
  \ vehicle and attached parachute, It models the deployment and inflation of the\
  \ parachute system. DSS has separate aerodynamic and mass properties for both the\
  \ vehicle and parachute.\r\nDSS is an in-house analysis tool. As such there is little\
  \ documentation on the modifications made to UD233A to create DSS.\r\n"
