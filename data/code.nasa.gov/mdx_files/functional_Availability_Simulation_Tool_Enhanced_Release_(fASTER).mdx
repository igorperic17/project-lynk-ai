description: fASTER is a Monte Carlo simulation tool that assists the International
  Space Station (ISS) Program with determining logistics support resources by simulating
  a multitude of different operational scenarios of the ISS configuration (during
  and following assembly). This allows for the impacts of complex program resource
  restrictions and constraints (e.g., crew maintenance time, carrier upmass capability,
  and sparing postulate) to be assessed and reported.
