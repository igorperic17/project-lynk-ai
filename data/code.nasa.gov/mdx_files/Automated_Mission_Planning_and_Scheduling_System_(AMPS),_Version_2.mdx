description: 'Five major components comprise the AMPS solution: (1) a C-language integrated
  production system (CLIPS) inference engine; (2) a graphical user interface (GUI);
  (3) a common object request broker architecture (CORBA); (4) a special functions
  component; and (5) a data component. CLIPS resolves currently active goals and objectives
  into a plan; a dynamic scheduler algorithm then expands the plan into a full schedule,
  adjusting it as needed.'
