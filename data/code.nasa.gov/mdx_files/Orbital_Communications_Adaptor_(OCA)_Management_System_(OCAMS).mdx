description: OCAMS is a simulation-to-implementation, multi-agent system-development
  methodology that combines ethnography, participatory design, multi-agent simulation,
  and agent-based systems integration. Employing the Brahms programming language,
  the technology automates tasks, leverages network infrastructure to distribute information,
  and links arbitrary hardware and software systems to teams of people on Earth and
  in space.
