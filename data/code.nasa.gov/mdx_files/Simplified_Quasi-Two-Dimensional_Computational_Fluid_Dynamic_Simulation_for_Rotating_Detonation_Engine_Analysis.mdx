description: A quasi-two-dimensional, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation
  of a rotating detonation engine (RDE) has been developed.  The simulation operates
  in the detonation frame of reference and utilizes a relatively coarse grid such
  that only the essential primary flow field structure is captured. This construction
  and other simplifications yield rapidly converging, steady solutions that can be
  obtained on a modern single processor computer.  Viscous effects, and heat transfer
  effects are modeled using source terms.  The effects of potential inlet flow reversals
  are modeled using boundary conditions.  Output from the simulation compares favorably
  to measured data from numerous experimental RDE rigs.  The speed and fidelity of
  the code render it useful as a performance optimization tool as well as a diagnostic
  tool to supplement the current limitations of experimental measurement techniques
  in the hostile engine environment.
