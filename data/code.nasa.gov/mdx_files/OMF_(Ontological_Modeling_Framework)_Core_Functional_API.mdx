description: The OMG core functional API adopts techniques from the field of functional
  programming languages, particularly Scala, for specifying the vocabulary of ontological
  modeling as a set of abstract types (that is, no commitment implied or assumed about
  any implementation of these abstract types) and a set of functional operations on
  these abstract types (that is, operations in the mathematical sense of pure functions
  that compute output values based on input values). This functional paradigm for
  specifying a domain allows a clean separation between the domain of ontological
  modeling (i.e., the focus of the OMF Core Functional API) from specific bindings
  for standards-based technology frameworks such as W3C's OWL, OMG's UML/SysML and,
  potentially, others. More importantly, the functional nature of this OMF Core API
  allows decoupling algorithms for analyzing, constructing, auditing, verifying, reasoning
  about OMF ontological models independently of the particular technology in which
  these ontological models are represented.
