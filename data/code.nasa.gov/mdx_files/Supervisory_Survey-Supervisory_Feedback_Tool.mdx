description: This application consists of an online survey that collects feedback
  from employees regarding their supervisors. Employees can anonymously review their
  immediate supervisor, a supervisor above their own immediate supervisor, or a matrixed
  supervisor. Feedback topic questions cover human resource management, communication,
  diversity and equal opportunity, and teamwork. The reports function allows supervisors
  to compare current feedback to feedback from previous surveys.
