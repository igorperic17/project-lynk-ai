description: SOMBAT is a multibody dynamics and control system simulation tool. It
  provides an integrated software environment to perform kinematic and dynamics analysis
  of space structures and robotic manipulators, including their control elements.
  The multibody system can consist of an arbitrary number of rigid and flexible bodies
  in an open-loop topology. The dynamics equations of a given system are generated
  in a computationally efficient and optimized form in SOMBAT using a symbolic code
  generator.
