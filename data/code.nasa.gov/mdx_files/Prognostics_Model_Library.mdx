description: The Prognostics Model Library is a modeling framework focused on defining
  and building models for prognostics (computation of remaining useful life) of engineering
  systems, and provides a set of prognostics models for select components developed
  within this framework, suitable for use in prognostics applications for these components.
  The library currently includes models for valves, pumps, and batteries. The Prognostics
  Model Library is implemented in MATLAB. The implementation consists of a set of
  utilities for defining a model (specifying variables, parameters, and equations),
  simulating the model, and embedding it within common model-based prognostics algorithms.
  A user can use existing models within the library or construct new models with the
  provided framework.
