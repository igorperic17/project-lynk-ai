description: "The Multiphysics Algorithm with Particles (MAP) is a multidimensional\
  \ adaptive Cartesian implementation of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)\
  \ method with paralellization capabilities using MPI. The DSMC method is widely\
  \ used for the modeling of gas flows through the computation of the motion and collisions\
  \ of representative molecules.  Computation at the molecular level is necessary\
  \ for studies in rarefied gas dynamics (RGD) because the transport terms in the\
  \ Navier-Stokes equations are not valid in this flow regime.  The essential characteristic\
  \ of a \"rarefied\" flow is that the molecular mean free path is not negligible.\r\
  \n\r\nThe software has been designed to be as automated as possible to achieve a\
  \ quality solution with minimal user input and control by performing dynamic adaptations\
  \ of the grid, local time step, and surface temperature.  The gas model includes\
  \ internal degrees of freedom (rotational, vibrational, and electronic), gas phase\
  \ chemical reactions, and surface reactions.  MAP uses an N-Level embedded Cartesian\
  \ grid system and a separate surface geometry that is embedded within the grid that\
  \ is made up of unstructured triangular elements."
