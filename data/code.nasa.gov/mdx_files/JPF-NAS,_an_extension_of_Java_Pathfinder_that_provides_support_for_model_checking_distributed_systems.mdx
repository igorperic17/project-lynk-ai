description: JPF-NAS is developed to provide support for model checking distributed
  applications.   It relies on the multiprocess support included in Java Pathfinder
  (JPF) which provides basic functionality to verify the bytecode of distributed applications.
  JPF-NAS is implemented as a JPF extension which models interprocess communication
  mechanisms. It uses a form of partial order reduction to explore all possible executions
  of a distributed Java application. Moreover, JPF-NAS provides a functionality to
  check the given distributed application under test against possible network failures
  which can occur at the operating system or the hardware layer.
