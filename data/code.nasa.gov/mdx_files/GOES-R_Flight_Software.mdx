description: 'The GOES-R Flight Software contains software components required to
  operate the GOES-R satellite.  Capabilities include Guidance, Navigation, Controls,
  and Propulsion (GNC&P) algorithm implementation, Electronic Power System (EPS) algorithm
  implementation, Thermal Control algorithm implementation, autonomous Fault Detection
  and Correction (FDC) capababilities, Command Processing, Telemetry Processing, Stored
  Command Processing, Instrument Payload Interfaces, BusIO command and control for
  Mil-Std-1553B bus interfaces, a layered driver architecture for GOES-R specific
  hardware interfaces and wrapped VxWorks 6.6 operating system capabilities, and an
  Executive application management capability.  The GOES-R Flight Software also contains
  modified BAE RAD750 SUROM Startup capabilities, modified BAE SpaceWire SUROM startup
  capabilities, and BAE Spacewire ASIC Embedded MicroController (EMC) software.  Finally,
  the GOES-R Flight Software contains a non-flight, Self Test Software (SELTS) component
  that allows for closed loop execution of the Flight Software during Integration
  and Test activities on the GOES-R Spacecraft.  '
