description: GFR (Glenn Flux Reconstruction) is a high-order computational fluid dynamics
  (CFD) Fortran code for large-eddy simulations. It is based on the simple and efficient
  flux reconstruction method and accurate to arbitrary order through a user-supplied
  input parameter. It is currently capable of using unstructured grids containing
  quadrilateral and hexahedra elements. The current release only supports UNIX-like
  operating systems.
