description: "This NASA software offers the ability to directly trace the real-time\
  \ execution of software to specific requirements, a unique capability that can only\
  \ be performed with a Timeliner-TLX system, as no other computer languages directly\
  \ report this data during execution. The tracing feature does not impose input/output\
  \ requirements (e.g., print/write statements) on the targeted software because the\
  \ tracing is performed by an outside program executing separately. The Timeliner-TLX\
  \ language is currently used for auto-procedures on the International Space Station\
  \ (ISS) and the Autonomous Mission Operations (AMO) project, and future manned deep-space\
  \ missions will require the use of extensive auto-procedures to assist in remote\
  \ intelligent operations.\r\n"
