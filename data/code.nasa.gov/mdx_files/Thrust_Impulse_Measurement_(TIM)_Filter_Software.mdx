description: 'The TIM filter is presently being used for small-force/thruster calibration
  during Phoenix mission flight operations, and is a key part of the orbit determination
  and maneuvering strategy to precisely navigate the spacecraft to the top of the
  "entry corridor" for its descent to the surface of Mars. '
