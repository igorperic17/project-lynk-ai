description: This software library leverages open source scientific computing tools
  to implement an efficient simulation framework for flight vehicles in Python. Equations
  of motion are composed in blocks using the SimuPy library, an open source Python
  alternative to Simulink, and integrated using SciPys wrappers for standard Fortran
  implementations of ordinary differential equation solvers. Dynamics equations of
  the inertial state variables for the position, orientation, and their corresponding
  rates for integration are developed using the SymPy symbolic library and implemented
  using code generation. Kinematics equations are implemented through symbolic definition
  and code generation as well as leveraging other open source software that implements
  useful functions, such as the solutions to the inverse geodesy problem.
