description: The NDE Wave & Image Processor software application has been created
  to provide a state-of-the-art, comprehensive, integrated science-based tool for
  the advanced visualization, processing, and analysis of NDE and health-monitoring
  waveform- and image-based data. With NDEWIP, the user has access to a complete post-processing
  capability in a single tool. Although the software has been developed for the NDE
  professional, the technology could be used for any other RF signal or image processing
  and analysis application.
