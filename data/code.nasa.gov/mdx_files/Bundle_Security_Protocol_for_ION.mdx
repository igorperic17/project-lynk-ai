description: The Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) communication system is an implementation
  of Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocols for space flight operations. It enables
  reliable automatic data communication over a network of arbitrarily complex topology
  comprising both deep-space links and more Internet-like connections. The bundle
  protocol is used in DTNs which overlay multiple networks, some of which may be challenged
  by limitations such as intermittent and possibly unpredictable loss of connectivity,
  long or variable delay, asymmetric data rates, and high error rates. The purpose
  of the bundle protocol is to support interoperability across such stressed networks.
