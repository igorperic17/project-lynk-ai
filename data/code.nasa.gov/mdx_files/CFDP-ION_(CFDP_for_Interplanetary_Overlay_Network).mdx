description: 'CFDP-ION is an implementation of CFDP that uses ION''s DTN implementation
  as its UT layer. The Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) communication system is
  an implementation of Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocols for space flight
  operations. It enables reliable automatic data communication over a network of arbitrarily
  complex topology comprising both deep-space links and more Internet-like connections.
  CFDP-ION includes implementations of the optional Proxy and Remote Directory Listing
  interoperable user operations defined in the CFDP standard. CFDP-ION utilizes the
  Interplanetary Communication Infrastructure (ICI) application interface offered
  by ION to invoke any operating system functionality that is not common to all POSIX-compliant
  operating systems. This enables CFDP-ION to be used without modification in VxWorks
  5.4, Solaris 9, OS/X, and various Linux distributions. '
