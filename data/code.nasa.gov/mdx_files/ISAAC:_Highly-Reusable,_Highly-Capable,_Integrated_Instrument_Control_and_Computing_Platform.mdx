description: This 3-year effort will start at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 with
  a Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) FPGA-based breadboard Xilinx ML410 for developing
  key ISAAC components, and will then be followed with custom design and fabrication
  of the ISAAC engineering model board by retrofitting the existing FPGA-based ESMD
  MicroInspector avionics board with respect to the instrument control and computing
  specific requirement. This effort will culminate with the system-level radiation
  test of complete ISAAC technology that matures it to TRL 6. Success of this effort
  will result in a flight-ready product in the 2010-time-frame for infusion into SMAP/HYDROS,
  one of Decadal flight missions.
