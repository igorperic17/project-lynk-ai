description: This is a flexible LaTeX document template designed to separate content
  from styling and remove all of the grunt work associated with creating professional
  documents. Can be used for technical reports as well as public documents such as
  research papers and conference papers. Includes builtin templates so that all the
  formatting is handled internally and in turn allows the end user to focus on the
  more important task of content creation.
