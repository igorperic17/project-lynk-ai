description: "The Ground Systems Development and Operations (GSDO) Program requires\
  \ a web-based application to effectively manage and coordinate the various components\
  \ of ground support equipment (GSE) used at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) throughout\
  \ the spacecraft and launch vehicle processing and integration flow, as well as\
  \ for launch pad operations.  \r\n\r\nA considerable amount of GSE is designed by\
  \ the Launch Vehicle and Spacecraft developers for KSC use during the ground processing\
  \ flow.  Additionally, KSC develops GSE for use during processing, launch preparation,\
  \ and launch activities.  All GSE used at KSC during the processing flow is tracked\
  \ and identified during ground operations planning activities.  The Ground Operations\
  \ Planning Database (GOPDb) provides the application to coordinate the various aspects\
  \ of the ground planning phase.  \r\n\r\nAdditional rigor and visibility into the\
  \ GSE component of ground operations planning is critical to a seamless and cost\
  \ effective planning and design phase.  An integrated GSE tracking solution must\
  \ be developed to provide visibility, accountability, and configuration control\
  \ of GSE data to all stakeholders while ensuring that the source data remains appropriately\
  \ controlled and protected.  \r\n\r\nThis  integrated GSE tracking and management\
  \ tool  the Ground Hardware Management Tool (GHMT)  Application - for tracking and\
  \ managing GSE data used in support of KSC\\GSDO operations planning and launch\
  \ campaigns.  \r\n\r\nThe GHMT will be fully integrated with the GOPDb to provide\
  \ a complete ground operations planning solution."
