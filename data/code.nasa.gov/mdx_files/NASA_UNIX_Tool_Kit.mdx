description: 'The NASA UNIX Tool Kit contains three components that all work together
  to form a single technology for UNIX administration: (1) Secure, Web-Based UNIX
  System Administration Tools (KSC-12269) ease the administration of a large, distributed
  UNIX system, providing a secure mechanism for creating, modifying, locking, and
  deleting users. (2) The second component of the software kit is the Client/Server
  to Create, Modify, and Query VERITAS File System Quotas on an NFS-Mounted File System
  with a Secure Web-Based Interface (KSC-12268). In this technology, the client (which
  exists on an internal secure platform with a secure interface) can be accessed from
  any authorized platform capable of running a Web browser. The server software exists
  on a UNIX platform configured with the VERITAS file system. (3) The Web-Based IP
  Address Tool (KSC-12271) provides an easy-to-use system for maintaining IP address
  information for a network of computers.'
