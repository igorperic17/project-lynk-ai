description: The GTM_DesignSim is a Matlab/Simulink simulation intended for design
  and analysis of flight control laws. It models the dynamics of a 5.5% scale model
  of a generic transport aircraft. The simulation was developed to allow fault accommodating
  control algorithms to be developed and refined in simulation before being tested
  on an experimental subscale model.
