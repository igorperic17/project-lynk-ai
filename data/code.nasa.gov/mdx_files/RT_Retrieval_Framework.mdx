description: This software retrieves a set of atmospheric/surface/instrument parameters
  from a simultaneous fit to spectra from multiple absorption bands. The software
  uses an iterative, non-linear retrieval technique (optimal estimation). After the
  retrieval process has converged, the software performs an error analysis. The products
  of the software include all quantities needed to understand the information content
  of the measurement, its uncertainty, and its dependence on interfering atmospheric
  properties. Spectra from ground-based or space-based measurement with arbitrary
  observation geometry can be analyzed. The retrieved parameters can be chosen from
  a large set of atmospheric (e.g., volume mixing ratio of gases or aerosol optical
  depth), surface (e.g., Lambertian reflection), and instrument (e.g., spectral shift
  or instrument line shape parameters) parameters. The software uses an accurate,
  state-of-the-art, multiple-scattering radiative transfer code combined with an efficient
  polarization approximation to simulate measured spectra. The software enables fast
  and highly accurate simulations of broad spectral ranges by an optional parallelization
  of the frequency processing in the radiative transfer model. The framework was written
  with flexibility in mind. New algorithms and instruments are added by creating additional
  classes that implement the defined interfaces. Bindings are available for both Python
  and Lua.
