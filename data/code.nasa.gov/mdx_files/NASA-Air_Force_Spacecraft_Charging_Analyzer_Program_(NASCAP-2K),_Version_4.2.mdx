description: NASCAP-2K is the next-generation spacecraft charging analysis code. The
  technology is a comprehensive update to the original NASCAP spacecraft charging
  codes written twenty years ago. A collaboration of NASA and the U.S. Air Force Research
  Lab (AFRL), the software builds upon the Air Force's DynaPAC charging algorithms
  and will replace 3D spacecraft charging codes for all environments.
