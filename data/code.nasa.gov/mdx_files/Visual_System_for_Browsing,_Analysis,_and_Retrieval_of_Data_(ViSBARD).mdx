description: 'ViSBARD provides a way of visualizing multiple vector and scalar quantities
  as measured by many spacecraft at once. The data are displayed three-dimensionally;
  may be displayed either as connected lines or as points; and allow the rapid determination
  of vector configurations, correlations between many measurements at multiple points,
  and global relationships. Please visit the following URL for additional information:
