description: GAIM is used to estimate the three-dimensional electron density distribution
  of the Earth's ionosphere as a function of time. To achieve high accuracy for users,
  the software accepts a wide variety of ionospheric measurements as input and produces
  output either in real time or in post-processing. The software can also generate
  predictions of the electron density structure for several hours or days into the
  future.
