description: Models the Contact Graph Routing (CGR) system proposed for future NASA
  missions and used in DINET1 and DINET2 experiments. Create a simulation environment
  of Contact Graph Routing that uses the QualNet network simulator and leverage the
  previously-developed space communication models. This protocol model can assist
  NASA network designers who wish to use Delay Tolerant Networking protocols with
  Contact Graph Routing.
