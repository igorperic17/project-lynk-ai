description: 'The marsautotie program generates tiepoints for use with the Mars pointing
  correction software in a completely automated manner, with no operator intervention.  It
  takes input images and finds overlaps according to the nominal pointing. It then
  finds the most "interesting" areas using a scene activity metric. Those points with
  most scene activity are most likely to be useful for tiepointing a mosaic. It then
  uses correlation techniques to find matching points in the overlapped image. Finally,
  it performs a series of steps to reduce the number of tiepoints to a manageable
  level. '
