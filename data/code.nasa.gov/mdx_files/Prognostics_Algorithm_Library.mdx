description: The Prognostics Algorithm Library is a suite of algorithms implemented
  in the MATLAB programming language for model-based prognostics (remaining life computation).
  It includes algorithms for state estimation and prediction, including uncertainty
  propagation. The algorithms take as inputs component models developed in Matlab,
  and perform estimation and prediction functions. The library allows the rapid development
  of prognostics solutions for given models of components and systems. Different algorithms
  can be easily swapped to do comparative studies and evaluations of different algorithms
  to select the best for the application at hand.
