description: "The GMSEC architecture is a comprehensive flight and ground system architecture\
  \ that spans the full mission lifecycle. Software components use the GMSEC Architecture\
  \ API to connect to a middleware software messaging bus that in turn is responsible\
  \ for message routing and delivery. The innovation of the GMSEC Architecture API\
  \ is the isolation of the middleware from the components, and the normalization\
  \ of the middleware behavior. This provides an isolation layer and prevents vendor\
  \ lock-in. \r\n\r\nThis software release contains major enhancements to previous\
  \ releases of the GMSEC API, including greater reliability and enhanced usability.\
  \ For example, this release includes a new feature which allows users to determine\
  \ quickly and easily if their current operations environment has been correctly\
  \ configured to use GMSEC.\"\r\n"
