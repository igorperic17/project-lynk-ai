description: The Mesh Network Communication System is a peer-to-peer communication
  network architecture that enables communication between network nodes of various
  types. The initial primary goal of the system was to enable communication between
  small formations of cubesats or other small satellites, but the basic mesh architecture
  is applicable to data exchange between network assets of any type. The system has
  been flight tested on formations of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) and shown
  to provide low latency data throughput for dynamic flight environments.
