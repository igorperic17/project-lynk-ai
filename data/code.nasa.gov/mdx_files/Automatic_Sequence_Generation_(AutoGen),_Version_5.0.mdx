description: Autogen is used for operations of MRO, MER, Mars Odyssey, and Phoenix,
  and was used on MGS. Through the use of Autogen for base sequence generation of
  these missions,operations cost have been significantly reduceds through the reduction
  in labor/timeand risk involved in the sequence generations process. It is widely
  recognized that a significant portion of the uplink command products fordeep space
  and interplanetary missions follow regular patterns.
