description: PO.DAAC provides access to several large datasets. Dealing with large
  datasets is challenging from the perspective of storage and access. Instead of downloading
  and storing large datasets locally it is often preferable to spatially subset them
  on a server side and store smaller pieces, or even use the pieces dynamically for
  an analysis and discard them. OPeNDAP is a popular service to extract subsets from
  data in netCDF and HDF. The matlab codes here download and subset level 2 datasets
  from PO.DAAC.
