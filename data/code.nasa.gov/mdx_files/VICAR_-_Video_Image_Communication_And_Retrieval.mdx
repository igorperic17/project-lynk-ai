description: 'VICAR, which stands for Video Image Communication And Retrieval, is
  a general purpose image processing software system that has been developed since
  1966 to digitally process multi-dimensional imaging data. VICAR was developed primarily
  to process images from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory''s unmanned planetary spacecraft.
  It is now used for a variety of other applications including biomedical image processing,
  cartography, earth resources, astronomy, and geological exploration. '
