description: 'The primary goal of this software is to process a robust water and mud
  classifier for all terrain conditions, for both day and night operations. This may
  be important for rover operations during exploration on other planetary bodies by
  future NASA missions. This task also involves assessing the hazard that detected
  water and mud presents and accurately placing detected water and mud into the vehicle
  level world model that an XUV uses to plan safe paths. '
