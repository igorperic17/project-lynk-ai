description: 'The primary goal of the Level 1 Processing software is to: 1. Qualify
  each data quantity using instrument configuration and checksum data as well as data
  transmission quality flags. Apply statistical tests for data quality and `reasonableness.''
  2. Calibrate the instrument engineering data (e.g., voltages, currents, temperatures
  and encoder angles). 3. Interpolate filter channel space reference measurements
  onto the times of each limb measurement and difference the interpolates from the
  measurements. 4. Interpolate filter channel calibration target measurements onto
  the times of each limb measurement and compute radiometric gain. 5.Determine the
  total signal power analyzed by each Digital Autocorrelator Spectrometer (DACS) during
  each data integration. 6. Convert each DACS data integration from an autocorrelation
  measurement in the time domain into a spectral measurement in the frequency domain.
  Finally produce a Log file summarizing instrument performance and outputs. '
