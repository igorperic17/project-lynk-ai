description: 'This is a set of computer program routines developed using Intel Visual
  Fortran Compiler software that calculates fluid system venturi and orifice inlet-to-throat
  pressure drops and inlet-to-exit pressure drops using highly accurate fluid properties
  through their interaction with a library workspace created from source code Fortran
  programs of the REFPROP database, which is produced by NIST. Can determine types
  of flow: compressible, cavitating chocked, etc., through the devices and adjusts
  computations accordingly as the program is running. '
