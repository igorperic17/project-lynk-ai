description: 'A standalone JavaScript library for reading the FITS astronomical file
  format. This library is built for modern browsers supporting the DataView object.
  These include at least Chrome 9, Firefox 15, and Safari 6. This library may be used
  to read various forms of the FITS format. This implementation is under active development.
  In its current state it supports the following: reading of multiple header data
  units, reading of FITS images, reading of data cubes, reading of binary tables,
  reading of ASCII Tables, and decompressing images using the Rice algorithm. '
