description: GLOBE members currently enter their scientific data using a Data Entry
  tool on GLOBEs site.  The GLOBE Cloud Data Entry App will allow non-GLOBE members
  and GLOBE members to enter cloud observations into their mobile device and send
  their observations to the GLOBE database. Users will be able to enter the data while
  the mobile device is not connected to the Internet, with data sent to GLOBE on user
  command when the device is on the Internet.
