description: 'The knife library calculates the boolean subtraction of arbitrary watertight
  triangular polyhedra. The result of this subtraction is also watertight triangular
  polyhedra. The triangular faces of the resultant polyhedra are created with a Delaunay
  triangle mesher. These polyhedra are suitable for performing cut cell partial differential
  equation solutions (i.e., computational fluid flow simulations). '
