description: "The purpose of HRN is to provide measurements to the Navigation Filter\
  \ so that it can limit errors on the position estimate after hazards have been detected.\
  \ The hazards are detected by processing a hazard digital elevation map (HDEM).\
  \ The HRN process takes lidar images as the spacecraft descends to the surface and\
  \ matches these to the HDEM to compute relative position measurements.\r\n\r\nThis\
  \ work is directly applicable to manned lunar landing. It is also directly applicable\
  \ to robotics landers on the moon, other planets and small bodies. It could be used\
  \ as a sensor approach for navigation of autonomous air vehicles for military and\
  \ surveillance purposes."
