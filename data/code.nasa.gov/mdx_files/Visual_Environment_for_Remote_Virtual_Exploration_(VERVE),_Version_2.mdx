description: VERVE is a 3D visualization system that provides situational awareness,
  science analysis tools, and data understanding capabilities for robotics researchers
  and exploration science operations. The technology is highly modular and extensible
  and includes a 3D scene-graph database, an interactive 3D viewer, and associated
  graphical user interfaces to OSGI plugin-based applications.
