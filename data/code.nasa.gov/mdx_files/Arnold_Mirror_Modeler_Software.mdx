description: This software creates complex finite element models of large-format,
  lightweight mirrors for complete input decks. Before, building these models could
  take engineers weeks or even months to complete a single iteration.  Now the modeler
  tool can do the same task in minutes. The software creates many levels of model
  complexity, from single mirrors (circular or hexagonal shapes) to arrays of mirror
  segments.  Models can have local reinforcement surrounding attachment points, and
  mesh can be refined (doubled) as many times as necessary.
