description: RAT reads telemetry information from a GPS receiver and determines the
  receiver's performance. As a telemetry-input file is read, an analyst can see the
  plotted satellites and telemetry information change in animated form. The analyst
  can halt the animation and generate high-quality PostScript images of the plot suitable
  for importing into post-flight reports.
