description: The Semantic Trend Analysis Tool uses linguistic analysis software and
  an ontology to extract new dimensions in data records that contain natural language
  text fields. Text fields in problem report data records (e.g., discrepancy reports,
  problem reports, corrective-action reports, and software change reports) might contain
  information that is critical to finding trends and groupings of recurring problems.
  STAT overcomes problems with scoping by linking up meaningful phrases that could
  be separated by text (e.g., "not aligned" versus "not completely aligned"). STAT's
  use of hierarchical ontologies overcomes the limitations of data codes, which are
  flat, closed, and have small sets of values that are often difficult to interpret.
  The ontology organizes aerospace terminology in hierarchies of types of problems,
  properties, objects, and functions. The tool identifies and tags types of problems
  and equipment mentioned in text fields, thereby providing new data files for record
  keeping. These new data files support text mining and clustering, report generation,
  browsing, and search at various levels of abstraction.
