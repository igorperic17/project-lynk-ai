description: Applications based upon pseudospectral algorithms share many characteristics
  and present common challenges to developers pushing the limits of high performance
  computing. Each investigation team generally tackles these challenges independently
  and reach various plateaus of performance that are well below those that are theoretically
  and demonstrably achievable. At the same time, pseudospectral algorithms have many
  unique characteristics that limit the applicability/efficacy of many software frameworks
  used by the high performance computing community. Such characteristics include "transposes"
  - large redistributions of data across an entire computing platform, nontrivial
  computational domains (e.g. spherical harmonic modes), little-or-no nearest-neighbor
  communication, and high computational intensity (DGEMM, FFT, etc). The goals of
  SpF (Spectral Framework) are to (1) reduce complexity and duplication of effort
  across multiple investigation teams, (2) achieve near optimal scalability on existing
  computing architectures (10"4-10"5 cores), (3) provide automation for domain decomposition
  and load balancing that circumvent hardwired constraints in existing applications,
  (4) provide automated and optimized global data "transpososes" that dominate compute
  time for large problems, (5) provide access to optimized numerical libraries including
  libraries implemented on hardware accelerators, and (6) provide a flexible/optimized
  input/output layer.
