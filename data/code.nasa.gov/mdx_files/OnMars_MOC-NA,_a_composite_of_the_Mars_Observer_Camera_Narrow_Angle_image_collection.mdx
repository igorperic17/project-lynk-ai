description: 'The MOC-NA mosaic provides one of the highest-resolution view of Mars.
  The technology used to build this mosaic can be used for other data sources. Together
  with the OnMars WMS server, this type of global composites available on-line can
  be used for data mining applications, for example change detection. The MOC-NA Mosaic
  is one of the highest resolution Mars image. The software application used to build
  this mosaic generates a very high resolution, very sparse image composite by reprojecting
  and blending one souce image at a time into the output dataset. '
