description: A calculation procedure has been designed and implemented in software
  that enables the specification and design of a space-based optical communications
  system. The resulting optical link budget essentially accounts for the communication
  power flow through the entire optical communications channel from the transmitter
  to the receiver and yields design specifications for the optical system necessary
  to assure reliable data transmission with desired operational metrics such as data
  rate, link margin, etc. The link assessment tool takes into account all the sources
  of deleterious noise that enters into the communications process such as electronically
  generated noise in the optical detector and stray optical irradiance from external
  sources. The link budget has the capability of being interfaced with the orbital
  element calculations of the Satellite Tool Kit (STK) to allow the dynamic description
  and evolution of optical link operation from any space-borne satellite within the
  solar system to and from the earth. The current version implements PPM and DPSK
  modulation types that can use PIN, APD, or nanowire optical detectors in the presence
  of atmospheric turbulence. Coded and un-coded link power margins are provided.  This
  version of the tool also has the ability 1) to solve for prevailing potential data
  rates given a desired optical power link margin and 2) treat the spatial separations
  of optical link transmitter and receiver within thefirst Fresnel zone.
