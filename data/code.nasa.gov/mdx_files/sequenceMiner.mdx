description: sequenceMiner was developed to address the problem of detecting and describing
  anomalies in large sets of high-dimensional symbol sequences. sequenceMiner works
  by performing unsupervised clustering (grouping) of sequences using the normalized
  longest common subsequence (LCS) as a similarity measure, followed by a detailed
  analysis of outliers to detect anomalies. sequenceMiner utilizes a new hybrid algorithm
  for computing the LCS that has been shown to outperform existing algorithms by a
  factor of five. sequenceMiner also includes new algorithms for outlier analysis
  that provide comprehensible indicators as to why a particular sequence was deemed
  to be an outlier. This provides analysts with a coherent description of the anomalies
  identified in the sequence, and why they differ from more 'normal' sequences.
