description: OnEarth-Boxes is a system that creates VM images for use in running,
  testing, and experimenting with the OnEarth and MRF tools. It uses Packer to produce
  a variety of pre-built VMs in different formats. OnEarth-Boxes comes pre-configured
  with NASA Blue Marble and MODIS Aerosol imagery layers, in 4 separate projections.
  There are OpenLayers endpoints for testing with WMTS, as well as TWMS/KML and Mapserver
  endpoints.
