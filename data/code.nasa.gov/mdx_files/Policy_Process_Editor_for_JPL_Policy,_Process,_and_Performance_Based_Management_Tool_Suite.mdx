description: This software would be considered generally valuable to both manned and
  unmanned science gathering programs. Because policy statements can be domain independent
  this software can equally be applied to a vast variety of different applications.
  We developed a process for automating the process of executing natural language
  enterprise policies. To support this process, a user interface needed to be built
  to allow users to initialize and monitor the process. This software provides this
  interface and exposes the features of the process for use by management, engineers,
  and operators alike.
