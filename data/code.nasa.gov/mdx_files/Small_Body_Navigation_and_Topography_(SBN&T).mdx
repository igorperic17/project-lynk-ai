description: SBN&T provides an integrated program for the spacecraft navigation and
  determination of small-body dynamics, shape, and high-resolution topography. Multiple-image
  stereography and photoclinometry are used to construct high-resolution topographic
  and albedo maps centers treated as control points. These landmark maps are re-illuminated
  and correlated with images to act as body-fixed navigation tie-points.
