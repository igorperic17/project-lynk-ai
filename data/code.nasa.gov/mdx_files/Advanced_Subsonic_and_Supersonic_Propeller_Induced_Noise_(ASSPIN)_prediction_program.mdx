description: ASSPIN is a computer program that predicts the noise generated by propellers
  operating at subsonic, transonic, or supersonic helical tip speeds in either single-rotation
  or counter-rotation mode. The format of blade surface pressure data obtained from
  aerodynamic codes for ASSPIN input is generally not compatible with that required
  by ASSPIN. The ASP_Tools suite provides the capability to manipulate blade geometry
  and surface pressure data to produce proper ASSPIN input. In addition, the ability
  to parse ASSPIN output files and obtain specific output variables is provided.
