description: "DAIDALUS is a reference implementation in Java and C++ of RTCA-228 detect\
  \ and avoid concept for the integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems into civil\
  \ airspace. DAIDALUS consists of algorithms for determining the current well-clear\
  \ status between two aircraft and for predicting a well-clear violation within a\
  \ lookahead time, assuming non-maneuvering trajectories. In the case of a predicted\
  \ well-clear violation, DAIDALUS also provides an algorithm that computes the time\
  \ interval of well-clear violation. Furthermore, DAIDALUS implements algorithms\
  \ for computing prevention bands, assuming a simple kinematic trajectory model.\
  \ Prevention bands are ranges of track, ground speed, and vertical speed maneuvers\
  \ that are predicted to be in well-clear violation within a given lookahead time.\r\
