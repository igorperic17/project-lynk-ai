description: 'METRIC model software can be used to calculate evapotranspiration (ET)
  rates of agricultural fields by executing the Measuring Evapotranspiration at High
  Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) model in an ArcGIS Python script.  The
  model requires input data from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS and local weather stations.  The
  creation of this software was motivated by the need to reduce irrigation costs for
  farmers and provide a means of drought monitoring for the agricultural industry.  This
  software has the potential to reduce the economic stress on the agricultural industry
  by enhancing crop productivity and irrigation efficiency.  '
