description: 'This software is written in fortran and Perl.  A set of input files
  define the desired image swath or flight plan, the radar constraints, flight parameters,
  and any ground targets that will be imaged.  The image swath or flight plan may
  be defined by either the image swath length, heading, and center coordinate, the
  flight path endpoints, or the image swath endpoints. The radar contraints define
  such things as the max and min PRF, data window length, data window position, pulse
  repetition interval, data rate, duty cycle, etc.  '
