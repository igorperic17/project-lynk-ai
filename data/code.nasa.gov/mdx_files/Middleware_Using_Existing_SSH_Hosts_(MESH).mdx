description: Mesh is a secure, lightweight grid middleware that is based on the addition
  of a single sign-on capability to the built-in public key authentication mechanism
  of SSH using system call interposition. Resources may be added to a Mesh-based grid
  in a matter of minutes using just five small files and two environment variable
  settings. Mesh adheres to fundamental security principles and was designed to be
  compatible with strong security mechanisms including two-factor authentication,
  SSH bastions, and restrictive firewalls. Mesh uses a remote command model, which
  is based on stock SSH clients and the syntax and commands already understood by
  users, thus requires no additional software or knowledge to utilize effectively.
  Several existing services have been integrated with Mesh to provide resource discovery
  and query, high performance file transfer, and job management.
