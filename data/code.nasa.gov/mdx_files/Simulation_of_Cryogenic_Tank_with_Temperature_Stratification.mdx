description: '''Simulation of Cryogenic Tank with Temperature Stratification'' is
  a MATLAB-based simulation of temperature stratification effects for cryogenic fluid
  in a tank. It is a reduced dynamical model describing temperature stratification
  effects driven by natural convection in a liquid hydrogen cryogenic tank. It accounts
  for storage, loading, and unloading of cryogenic fluid.'
