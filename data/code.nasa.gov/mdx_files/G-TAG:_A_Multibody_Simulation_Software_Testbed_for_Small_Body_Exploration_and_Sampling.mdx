description: Any future small body mission will benefit from using this software.
  Indeed the software has already been extensively used. This software tool is used
  for the multi-body simulation of a spacecraft with a robotic arm and a sampling
  mechanism, which performs a touch-and-go (TAG) maneuver for sampling from the surface
  of a small celestial body. G-TAG utilizes G-DYN, a multi-body simulation engine,
  and interfaces to controllers, estimators, and environmental forces that affect
  the spacecraft. G-TAG can easily be adapted for the analysis of stress cases to
  assist the design of a TAG system as well as for comprehensive Monte-Carlo simulations
  to analyze a particular TAG system.
