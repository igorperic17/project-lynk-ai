description: STAMPS simulates either three- or six-degrees-of-freedom cases for all
  shuttle flight phases using translated HAL flight software or generic GN&C models.
  Single or multiple trajectories can be simulated for use in optimization and dispersion
  analysis. The technology includes math models for the vehicle and environment and
  a C version of shuttle onboard flight software.
