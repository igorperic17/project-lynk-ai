description: This software provides a construction method for protograph-based Low
  Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes that simultaneously achieve low iterative decoding
  thresholds and linear minimum distance. The technology can be used for various code
  rates. Proposed codes may have either fixed input block or fixed output block sizing.
  Both cases provide rate compatibility. In fact, one encoder and one decoder can
  support different code rates.
