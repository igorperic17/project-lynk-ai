description: 'This tool is now being used in the flight operations environment to
  document the MRO and multi-mission autogen/apgen model files. These hypertext maps
  are also being used in multi-mission autogen/apgen training sessions. The autogen
  hyper text map generator parses the autogen script and the autogen model files and
  produces a hypertext of the files to aid in the navigation of the model. '
