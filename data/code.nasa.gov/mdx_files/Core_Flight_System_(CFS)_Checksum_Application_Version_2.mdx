description: Checksum (CS) is one of the reusable applications that make up the Core
  Flight System (CFS). The technology performs memory integrity management by verifying
  the contents of critical flight memory regions. Unexpected changes in memory (i.e.,
  due to an SEU) are reported to ground operators.
