description: 'The design of trajectories for interplanetary missions represents one
  of the most complex and important problems to solve during conceptual space mission
  design. To facilitate conceptual interplanetary mission sizing activities, it is
  essential to obtain sufficiently accurate trajectories in a fast and repeatable
  manner. To this end, the VISITOR software tool was developed. This tool modularly
  augments a patched conic, multiple gravity-assist with one deep space manuever (MGA-1DSM)
  trajectory model with a mass model, launch window analysis, and the capability to
  simulate realistic arrival and departure operations. The tool was validated against
  seven flown missions: the average total mission delta-V offset from the nominal
  trajectory was 9.1%, and was reduced to 7.3% when using the genetic algorithm at
  the cost of an increase in computation time by a factor 5.7. VISITOR is well-suited
  for the conceptual design of interplanetary trajectories and facilitates future
  improvements due to its modular structure.'
