description: GOBBS is a Web-based application that enables managers and supervisors
  to advertise special employment opportunities to a broader audience. Employees can
  be grouped organizationally (e.g., all of Division 1) or by skills/experience bases
  (e.g., engineering, administrative, etc.). Parties interested in a given employment
  announcement can apply online with minimal effort. GOBBS does not replace Competitive
  Placement Plan vacancy announcements that require competition-through-merit promotion
  procedures.
