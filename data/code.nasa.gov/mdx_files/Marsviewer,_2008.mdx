description: 'This program (marsviewer) is designed for quality control, browsing,
  and operational and science analysis of images and derived image products returned
  by spacecraft, primarily in-situ missions (e.g. MER, PHX, MSL). It allows all derivd
  products (Reduced Data Records, or RDR''s) associated with each original image (Experiment
  Data Record, or EDR) to be viewed in various ways, including in stereo, depending
  on the type of image.The program features a pluggable interface called a "file finder". '
