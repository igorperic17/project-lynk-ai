description: From gate departure to gate arrival, ACES is a dynamic, event-based computer
  simulation of aircraft operations in the National Airspace System (NAS). The technology's
  software-agent infrastructure provides flexibility in configuring custom simulations
  and enables explicit modeling of command and control entities operating within the
  NAS.
