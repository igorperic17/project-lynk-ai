description: This software was developed to solve Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
  Equations to simulate turbulent, viscous flows over three-dimensional configurations.
  A general multiblock grid is used to model complex configurations. A multi-stage
  Runge-Kutta pseudo-time stepping scheme is coupled with residual smoothing and multigrid
  acceleration techniques to form an efficient algorithm. TLNS3D-MB was the first
  CFD code to demonstrate grid independent convergence rate for transonic viscous
  flows over wing/fuselage configurations.
