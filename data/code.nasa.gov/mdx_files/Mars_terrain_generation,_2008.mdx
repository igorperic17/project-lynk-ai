description: The XYZ images produced by this program suite are the fundamental images
  used to create the terrain meshes used by the Rover Planners to safely drive and
  conduct arm operations. They are the way that RP tools interact with the rover's
  environment. They are on the critical path for the daily command cycle of MER, PHX,
  and (soon) MSL.
