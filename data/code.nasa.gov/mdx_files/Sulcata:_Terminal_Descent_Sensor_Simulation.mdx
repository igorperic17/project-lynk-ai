description: Used in the development of Mars Science Laboratory. TDS, which provides
  critical data to GNC needed for safe landing on Mars Simulates the response of the
  MSL radar during descent. Sulcata is a high-fidelity simulation of the MSL TDS (radar).
  It is used for performance evaluation, anomaly resolution, and design validation.
