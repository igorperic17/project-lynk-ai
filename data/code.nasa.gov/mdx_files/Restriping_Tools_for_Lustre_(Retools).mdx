description: Retools is a set of modifications to the commonly used open source utilities
  bzip2, gzip, rsync, and tar that automatically selects the Lustre stripe count for
  created and/or extracted files according to the sizes of the files involved. By
  striping large files over a higher number of physical disks and small files over
  a lower number, aggregate I/O bandwidth for large files is maximized and the impact
  to the file system due to small files is minimized. These tools support the typical
  workflow in high performance computing environments where users compress large files
  and/or aggregate multiple small files into a single archive during remote transfers.
  Once uncompressed/unarchived into their original form, these files will be optimally
  striped for subsequent operations.
