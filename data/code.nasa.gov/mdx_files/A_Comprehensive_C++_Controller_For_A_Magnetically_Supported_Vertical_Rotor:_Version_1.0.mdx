description: FATMaCC (Five-Axis, Three-Magnetic-Bearing Control Code), is a versatile
  control code that possesses many desirable features that were not available in previous
  in-house controllers.  The ultimate goal in designing this code was to achieve full
  rotor levitation and control at a loop time of 50 s.  Using a 1-GHz processor the
  code will control a five-axis system in either a decentralized or a more elegant
  centralized (model control) mode at loop time of 56  s.  In addition, it will levitate
  and control (with only minor modification to the input-output wiring) a two-axis
  and / or a four-axis system.  Stable rotor levitation and control of any of the
  system mentioned above are accomplished through appropriate key presses to modify
  parameters, such as stiffness, damping, and bias.  A signal generation block provides
  11 excitation signals.  An excitation signal is then superimposed on the radial
  bearing x- and y- control signals, thus producing a resultant force vector.  By
  modulating the signals on the bearing x0 and y- axes with a cosine and sine function,
  respectively, a radial excitation force vector is made to rotate 360 about the bearing
  geometric center.  The rotation of the force vector is achieved manually by using
  key press or automatically by engaging the " one-per-revolution" feature.  Rotor
  rigid body modes can be excited by using the excitation module.  Depending on the
  polarities of the excitation signal in each radial bearing, the bounce or tilt mode
  will be excited
