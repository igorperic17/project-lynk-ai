description: 'The method works as follows: an earthquake''s epicenter is located using
  seismometer data. GPS displacement data from stations near the epicenter are then
  gathered to derive seafloor motions. Based upon these data, local topography data
  and new theoretical developments, a new "tsunami scale" measurement from one to
  10 is generated, much like the Richter Scale used for earthquakes. The scale is
  then used to discriminate earthquakes capable of generating destructive tsunamis
  from those unlikely to do so.'
