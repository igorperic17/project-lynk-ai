description: NASA has integrated industry-standard and new, novel analysis methods
  for assessing the structural health of composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPV).
  By significantly increasing throughput, the software has the ability to provide
  real-time assessments. Adaptive analysis methods have been incorporated into the
  technology to provide modal analyses at specified points of a structure's life (e.g.
  loading, unloading, and dwells), thereby increasing the tool's utility and ease
  of use for acoustic emission testing.
