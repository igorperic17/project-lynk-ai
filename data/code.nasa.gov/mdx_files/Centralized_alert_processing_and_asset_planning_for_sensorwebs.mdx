description: 'This NASA Earth Science Sensorweb has been in operational use since
  2003 and has proven reliability of the sensorweb technologies for robust event detection
  and autonomous response using space and ground assets.While the NRO DII demonstration
  highlights the maturity of sensorweb technologies, our work with NRO highlights
  a number of areas for further work to move forward in infusing sensorweb technologies
  into NRO operational usage. In the event detection area, additional work in: Timeseries
  Situational Awareness, Wide area and local surveillance, and Change detection and
  focus of attention would further enhance the utility of sensorweb technologies to
  the NRO. '
