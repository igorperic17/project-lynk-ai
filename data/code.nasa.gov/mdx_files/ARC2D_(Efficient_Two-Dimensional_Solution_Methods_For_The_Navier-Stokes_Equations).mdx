description: ARC2D is a computational fluid dynamics program developed at the NASA
  Ames Research Center specifically for two-dimensional airfoil and simply connected
  geometries.  The program uses implicit finite-difference techniques to solve two-dimensional
  Euler equations and Navier-Stokes equations.  It is based on the Beam and Warming
  implicit approximate factorization algorithm in generalized coordinates.  The methods
  are either time accurate or accelerated non-time accurate steady state schemes.  The
  evolution of the solution through time is physically realistic; good solution accuracy
  is dependent on mesh spacing and boundary conditions.
