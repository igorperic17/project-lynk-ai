description: Release 6.0 of ITPS was developed to provide the Fermi mission with an
  improved ability to handle multiple long-term trending jobs without adjusting the
  time range and reselecting all the options. This release also provides more flexibility
  in the use of input definition files (IDFs). IDFs are used in the generation of
  ITPS trending products and contain selected mnemonics, filtering information, and
  output formats.
