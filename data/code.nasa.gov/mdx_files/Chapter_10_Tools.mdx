description: The Dryden Aeronautical Test Range (DATR) staff at the NASA Armstrong
  Flight Research Center has developed a software toolkit called Chapter 10 Tools
  in response to challenges posed by post-flight processing data files originating
  from various on-board digital recorders that follow the Range Commanders Council
  Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) 106 Chapter 10 Digital Recording Standard
  but use differing interpretations of the Standard. This software toolkit will read
  the data files regardless of the vendor implementation of the source recorder, display
  data, identify and correct errors, and produce a data file that can be successfully
  processed post-flight.
