description: 'The code has specifically been developed with the aim of providing a
  predictive capability to NASA science missions using Hall thrusters. The code has
  been developed to allow designers to predict the life of a given thruster design
  based on the actual mission profile. HPHall is an axisymmetric (3-dimensional excavation
  which is rotationally symmetric about an axis) solver that employs a hybrid fluid/particle-in-cell
  (hybrid-PIC) numerical approach to simulate the evolution of the plasma inside the
  discharge chamber and near-field plume of a Hall thruster. '
