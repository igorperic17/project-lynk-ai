description: This NASA algorithm first detects the outlier within a Doppler signal
  ensemble and then weights the magnitude of the outlier by the magnitude of the B-mode
  at the same point in space. Thresholding, color scaling, and spatial filtering are
  applied to output detection, and the information is overlaid onto the B-mode image
  in real time.
