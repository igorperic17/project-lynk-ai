description: The QuIP interpreter, a software environment for QUick image processing,
  uses an interactive scripting language designed to facilitate use by non-expert
  users, through features such as context-sensitive automatic response completion
  and integrated documentation.  The package includes a number of script packages
  that implement high-, medium-, and low-level functions (e.g., analysis of eye images
  for human gaze tracking, feature tracking, and image filtering). The environment
  also includes facilities for displaying images on screen, drawing and overlaying
  graphics, and constructing graphical user interfaces using the scripting language.  Currently
  supported platforms are *NIX (tested on Mac OS X and Linux), and Apple iOS.
