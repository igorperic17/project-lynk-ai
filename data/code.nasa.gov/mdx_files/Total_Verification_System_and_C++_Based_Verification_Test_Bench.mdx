description: This technology verifies complex space flight digital designs in a more
  thorough manner than was previously possible while offering cost savings and reduced
  schedule time. The software combines a custom-designed GSE unit, the Total Verification
  System, along with a powerful test bench environment that uses C++. Together, these
  elements allow a high level of code reuse between all the phases of the design and
  test cycle.
