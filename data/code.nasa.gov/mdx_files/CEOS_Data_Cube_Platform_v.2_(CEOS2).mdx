description: "The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) has long recognized\
  \ a need for data processing infrastructure to support Earth science objectives\
  \ in developing countries.  Forest preservation initiatives, carbon measurement\
  \ initiatives, water management and agricultural monitoring are just few examples\
  \ of causes that can benefit greatly from remote sensing data.  Currently, however,\
  \ many developing nations lack the in-country expertise and computational infrastructure\
  \ to utilize remote sensing data.\r\n\r\nThe CEOS Data Cube Platform provides a\
  \ flexible model to address these needs.  The CEOS Data Cube Platform is a data\
  \ processing platform for Earth science data, with a focus on remote-sensing data.\
  \  The platform provides a data ingestion framework that includes support for automated\
  \ ingestion of a wide variety of remote sensing data products.  The data products\
  \ are ingested into an N-dimensional data array that abstracts away management of\
  \ distinct acquisitions.   The platform has a tiered API for data processing and\
  \ a data/application platform layer for higher-level access."
