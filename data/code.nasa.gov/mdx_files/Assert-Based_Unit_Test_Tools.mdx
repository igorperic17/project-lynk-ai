description: 'The ut-assert unit test tools provide a unit test framework and a collection
  of utilities that are designed to facilitate unit testing. These tools implement
  an assertion-based testing philosophy that requires the developer to explicitly
  write verification statements that assert whether a condition is true or false.  This
  approach is much different than the Flight Software Branch''s historical approach
  to unit testing that creates a log file that requires developer analysis in order
  to determine whether a test passed or failed. In order to use the tools a developer
  populates the framework with their unit tests and links with the ut-asssert library
  to create an executable. '
