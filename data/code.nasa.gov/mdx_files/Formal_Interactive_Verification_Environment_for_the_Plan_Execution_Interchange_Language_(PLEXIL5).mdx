description: The Plan Execution Interchange Language (PLEXIL) is an open source synchronous
  language developed by NASA for commanding and monitoring autonomous systems. PLEXIL
  Formal Interactive Verification Environment (PLEXIL5) is a tool that implements
  a formal executable semantics of PLEXIL. PLEXIL5 includes a graphical interface
  that enable access to formal verification techniques such as model-checking, symbolic
  execution, theorem proving, and static analysis of plans. The graphical environment
  supports formula editing and visualization of counterexamples, interactive simulation
  of plans at different granularity levels, and random initialization of external
  environment variables.
