description: "The General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) is the worlds only enterprise,\
  \ multi-mission, open source software system for space mission design, optimization,\
  \ and navigation. The system supports missions in flight regimes ranging from low\
  \ Earth orbit to lunar, libration point, and deep space missions. GMAT is developed\
  \ by a team of NASA, private industry, public, and private contributors and is used\
  \ for real-world mission support, engineering studies, as a tool for education,\
  \ and public engagement.\r\n\r\nGMAT contains models of real world objects such\
  \ as spacecraft and thrusters, and analysis \"objects\" such as propagators, plots,\
  \ and reports. These objects are used in a mission sequence in which the user employs\
  \ commands supported by the system to model mission events and perform estimation.\r\
  \n\r\nFor a complete list of new features, compatibility changes, and bug fixes,\
  \ see the Release Notes.  Below are just some of the new capabilities contained\
  \ in this release. \r\nProduction quality orbit determination (Operational Certification\
  \ expected in November, 2016)\r\nCode 500 ephemeris propagator\r\nSTK ephemeris\
  \ file output\r\nWrite command to save GMAT configurations during execution\r\n\
  Include macro to load GMAT configurations from external sources during execution\r\
  \nMany new built in math functions and parameters\r\n130 pages of new user documentation\r\
  \n"
