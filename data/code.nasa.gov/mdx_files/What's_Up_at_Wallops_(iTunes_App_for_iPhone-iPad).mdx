description: 'The public community has a desire and an expectation to understanding
  more about the purpose and relevance of our missions. Furthermore, the public community
  has an interest in knowing more about the technical and logistical details about
  our missions, especially as those details enable them to experience launches and
  flight projects as spectators. This mobile application will provide simple, intuitive,
  dynamic tools that would provide an assortment of material to the public to answer
  a variety of questions: Whens the next launch? Why are you doing that? What should
  I expect to see? Where should I look? How can I follow along with the countdown?'
