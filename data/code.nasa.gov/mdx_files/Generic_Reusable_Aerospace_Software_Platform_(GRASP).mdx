description: The purpose of GRASP is to provide a generic operating-system-independent
  framework for creating multi-process real-time applications. In the modular GRASP
  architecture, all operating system and hardware interfaces are isolated within GRASP
  libraries. The application developer uses GRASP interface libraries and device drivers
  to interact with external hardware. Should a new hardware item require a driver,
  that development would be part of GRASP and would be added to the GRASP interface
  libraries and become available for future projects. GRASP application software is
  developed by using the GRASP template, which offers access to the services GRASP
  provides. The templated generic code handles process initialization, thread creation,
  inter-process messaging, process health monitoring, data logging, data distribution,
  etc., with hooks that provide for subsystem tailoring. Using GRASP allows application
  developers to concentrate on mission specifics, reducing development time, cost,
  and risk.
