description: Scenario Scheduler is a Java software application that is integrated
  with the Goddard Mission Services Evolution Center (GMSEC) application program interface
  for use in Mission Operations Centers. The application stores activity lists or
  "scenarios" for execution in a timeline- and/or event-driven nature. The application
  is set up via a flat file schedule of activities to perform. Scenario Scheduler
  is redundant and both execution nodes work together in a prime/backup mode with
  automatic failover.
