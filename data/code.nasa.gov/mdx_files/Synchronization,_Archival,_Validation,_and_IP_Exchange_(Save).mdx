description: Save is a high-availability framework that manages IP addresses shared
  between multiple servers. It also monitors the health of those servers to determine
  which one should be actively servicing requests at any given time. Synchronization
  mechanisms allow configuration files to be kept consistent between systems and also
  allow commands to be executed across all servers of a particular type. Archival
  mechanisms provide automatic version control of configuration files to aid in recovery
  in case of errant configuration.
