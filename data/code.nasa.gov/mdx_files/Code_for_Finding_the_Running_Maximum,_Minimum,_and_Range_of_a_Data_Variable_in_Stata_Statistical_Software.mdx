description: This technology is used to create a data variable that contains the running
  maximum, minimum, and range (maximum minus minimum) of another variable in a Stata
  data set. The code can also conceptually divide a data set according to values of
  other variables and calculate the running maximum, minimum, or range separately
  within each division.
