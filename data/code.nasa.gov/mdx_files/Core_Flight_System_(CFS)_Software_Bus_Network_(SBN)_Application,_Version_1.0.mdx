description: 'The SBN serves as a plug-in to the cFE framework to transfer messages
  across process/processor interfaces. The technology has three primary functions:
  to establish and maintain a connection to each peer over available process/processor
  interfaces; to distribute and maintain a subscription message database for each
  peer; and to distribute messages to peers that have subscribed to message identifiers.'
