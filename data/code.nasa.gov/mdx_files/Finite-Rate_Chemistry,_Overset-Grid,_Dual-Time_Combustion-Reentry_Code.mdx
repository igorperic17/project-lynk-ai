description: This technology modifies the OVERFLOW code for finite rate and equilibrium
  chemistry by substituting the perfect gas model built into the code with a model
  assuming a gas made up of a mixture of thermally perfect gases. Four extra field
  variables were added, corresponding to pressure, temperature, coefficient of thermal
  conductivity, and the new pressure derivative X.
