description: 'The SPS UIP is currently being used in direct support of spacecraft
  tracking activities in the Deep Space Network. This suite of UIs could be adapted
  to support operations environments requiring upload and management of input complex,
  interdependent input data, and monitor and control of a implementation utilizing
  an SQL-compliant database. Interaction with a complex DBMS system is a tedious and
  error-prone process that requires highly-trained professionals. '
