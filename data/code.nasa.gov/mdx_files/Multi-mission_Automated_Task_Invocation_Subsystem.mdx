description: 'This software benefits flight projects by lowering development and operations
  costs, and reducing risks while increasing reliability. Although implemented to
  support instrument product generation, other project teams or subsystems requiring
  timely and reliable execution of programs and applications across all mission phases
  could utilize these capabilities. MATIS s a distributed data processing framework
  for the automated generation of instrument products. It is a workflow manager that
  executes programs in a specific order and under specific conditions. '
