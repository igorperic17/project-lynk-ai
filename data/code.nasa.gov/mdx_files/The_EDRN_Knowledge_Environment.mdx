description: JPL has provided the underlying infrastructure to share data increasing
  the study power associated with capturing and comparing information. The infrastructure
  provides software services including data processing and management (eCAS), biomarker
  data management (BMDB), specimen data management (ERNE), and a portal to link the
  system together and provide access. These are software built on top of the Apache
  OODT software services.
