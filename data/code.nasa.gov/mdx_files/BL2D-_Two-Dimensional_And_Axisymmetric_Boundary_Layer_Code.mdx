description: "BL2D:  An efficient and fourth-order accurate method to compute two-dimensional\
  \ and axisymmetric boundary layers on aerospace vehicle wings from low-speed to\
  \ hypersonic speeds.\r\n\r\nAerospace applications include boundary-layer stability\
  \ analysis, transonic wing design, laminar flow wing design.\r\n"
