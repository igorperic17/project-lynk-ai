description: Timeline Builder Assistant is intended to support initial surface operations
  planning by quickly building mission timelines with the "Building Blocks" method.  The
  result produces a possible approach to completing all mission requirements and is
  intended for basic feasibility analysis.  To build a new timeline, the user is prompted
  to enter the name of each building block and the number of times it is to be used.  The
  program builds an EVA timeline to complete science and exploration objectives while
  complying with current human spaceflight limits on the number of hours of EVA allowed
  per day and week.  At completion, the program displays the timeline, number of days
  to complete all requirements, number of rest days, and number of sites visited.  The
  database keeps a record of activities and building blocks used in all surface missions
  and is easily searchable by the user or the program.
