description: 'This instrument can be used for surveying of planetary landscapes by
  spectral imaging. It can also be used for battlefield surveillance and spectral
  imaging of live tissues for disease detection. CTIS (Computed Tomography Imaging
  Spectrometer) is a novel instrument that enables transient-level multi-spectral
  imaging by capturing spatial and spectral information in a single snapshot. '
