description: Automates the deployment of nowcasting and forecasting hydrologic simulations
  and ingests satellite observations (through data assimilation). Allows coupling
  of other environmental models. Also facilitates delivery of data products to users
  via a GIS-enabled database.  users of project outputs through CCAFS network of partners.
  Our project objectives, and approach are integral with the goals of SERVIR.
