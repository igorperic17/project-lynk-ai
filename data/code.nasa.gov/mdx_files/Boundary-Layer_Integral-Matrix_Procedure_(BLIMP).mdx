description: The Boundary-Layer Integral-Matrix Procedure (BLIMP) software provides
  fast, highly accurate solutions to gas-phase boundary-layer flow problems encompassing
  a broad range of boundary conditions. The tool is capable of obtaining accurate
  and economical solutions to governing differential equations of momentum, energy,
  and species.
