description: 'An important aspect of mission planning for NASAs operation of the International
  Space Station is the allocation and management of space for supplies and equipment.
  The Stowage, Configuration Analysis, and Operations Planning teams collaborate to
  perform the bulk of that planning. A Geometric Reasoning Engine is developed in
  a way that can be shared by the teams to optimize item placement in the context
  of crew planning. '
