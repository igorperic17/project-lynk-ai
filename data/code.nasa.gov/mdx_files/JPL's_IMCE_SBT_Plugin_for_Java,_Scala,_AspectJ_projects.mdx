description: This sbt plugin aggregates a few community plugins used across several
  projects in JPL's Integrated Model-Centric Engineering initiative and in OMG's Tool
  Infrastructure Working Group. There is an inherent tradeoff between maintaining
  slight variations of similar build configurations across multiple projects (i.e.
  no common sbt plugin) and defining a common sbt plugin reused across multiple projects
  to simplify their build configurations. Conceptually, the scope and purpose of this
  sbt plugin is very similar to the elegant nice-sbt-settings. Practically, nice-sbt-settings
  is indeed nicer.
