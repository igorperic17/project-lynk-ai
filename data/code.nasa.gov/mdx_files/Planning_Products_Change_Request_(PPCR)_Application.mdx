description: For the International Space Station (ISS) mission plan, this comprehensive
  change-request management tool offers built-in workflow processes to track condition-related
  information and thousands of tasks and activities. The technology allows planners
  to view a summary of all of the changes for any one mission day, even though the
  changes may have been received via multiple PPCRs and from various other flight
  controllers and disciplines.
