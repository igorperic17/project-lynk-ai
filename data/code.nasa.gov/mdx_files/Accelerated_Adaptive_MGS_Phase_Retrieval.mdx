description: 'The Modified Gerchberg-Saxton (MGS) algorithm is an image-based wavefront
  sensing method that can turn any science instrument focal plane into a wavefront
  sensor. MGS has been utilized on many projects, and has been demonstrated on many
  optical systems, from laboratory testbeds to space telescopes. '
