description: 'The MEM model can be used to describe the meteoroid environment anywhere
  in the inner solar system. Incorporating a physics-based approach rather than traditional
  empirical fits, the model provides important information necessary for spacecraft
  survivability, including meteoroid directionality and velocity distributions. '
