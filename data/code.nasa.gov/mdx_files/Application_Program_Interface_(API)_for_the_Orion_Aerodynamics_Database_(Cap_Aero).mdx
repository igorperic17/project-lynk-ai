description: Programmed in C, CAP Aero was developed to provide software developers
  an easily implemented, fully self-contained method for accessing the Crew Exploration
  Vehicle's Aerodynamic Database. No special functions (file read/write, table lookup,
  etc.) are required on the host system other than those included with a standard
  ANSI C installation. CAP Aero reads files of aero-data tables formatted as specified
  in the document, "Aerotab Data File Format." The aerodynamic coefficients and forces
  calculated by the program follow the equations cited in the document, "Formulation
  of the Orion Aerodynamic Database."
