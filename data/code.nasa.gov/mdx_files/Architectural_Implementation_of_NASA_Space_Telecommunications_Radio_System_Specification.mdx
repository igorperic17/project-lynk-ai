description: 'This software performs the Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS)
  Architecture Standard for software-defined radios (SDRs), which is an open architecture
  for NASA space and ground radios. The STRS standard provides a common, consistent
  framework to develop, qualify, operate and maintain complex reconfigurable and reprogrammable
  radio systems. This architecture standard provides a detailed description and set
  of requirements to implement the architecture. '
