description: "This is a technique for converting a constrained optimization problem\
  \ into an unconstrained problem.  The technique transforms one or more objective\
  \ functions into reduced objective functions analogous to goal constraints used\
  \ in the goal programming method. The reduced objective\r\nfunctions are appended\
  \ to the set of constraints and an envelope of the entire function set is computed\
  \ using the Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser function.  This envelope function is then\
  \ searched for an unconstrained minimum. The technique may be categorized as a SUMT\
  \ algorithm.  Version 3.1 is written in the FORTRAN 90/95 standard and improves\
  \ upon the robustness of the code by preventing potential memory allocation errors."
