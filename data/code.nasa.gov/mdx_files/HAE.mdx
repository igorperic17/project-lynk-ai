description: "Using the cloud-based computing power of Google Earth Engine (GEE),\
  \ the Hydrologic Anomaly Index (HAE) is capable of uploading and analyzing large\
  \ amounts of Earth observation climate data for the purpose of hydrologic analysis\
  \ and monitoring. The end-user will be able to pull from and modify a library of\
  \ scripts that are stored in Earth Engine, as well as upload and access data stored\
  \ on a private data catalog. The final stage of development of the tool will include\
  \ a more user-friendly application built using Google\u2019s App Engine, in which\
  \ users will be able to display data products and interactive maps."
