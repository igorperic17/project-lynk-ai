description: Enhancements and modifications to a code developed for plume spectral
  data analysis in 1994 have made the original computer program applicable to the
  Space Shuttle Maine Engine and the Diagnostic Test-bed Facility Thruster (DTFT).
  The new code can now handle the non-uniform wavelength intervals at which spectral
  computations are made.
