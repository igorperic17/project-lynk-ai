description: The Checksum application (CS) is a core Flight System (cFS) application
  that is a plug in to the Core Flight Executive (cFE) component of the cFS. Checksum
  (CS) is one of the reusable applications that make up the Core Flight System (CFS).
  The technology performs memory integrity management by verifying the contents of
  critical flight memory regions. Unexpected changes in memory (i.e., due to an SEU)
  are reported to ground operators.
