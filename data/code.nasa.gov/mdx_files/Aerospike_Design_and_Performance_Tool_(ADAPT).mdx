description: The ADAPT computer code designs and analyzes the performance of linear,
  annular, or plug-cluster aerospike engines. ADAPT can automatically evaluate aerospike
  nozzle performance over a wide variation of independent design variables, and it
  can be used in concert with other built-in analysis techniques to optimize aerospike
  nozzles over an entire flight envelope. Any propellant system can be modeled. Outputs
  of the code include files that contain the thruster/spike contour and a summary
  output file for each thruster/spike design point, as well as vacuum and delivered
  performance data for the thruster and the entire thruster/spike module. One-dimensional
  performance data are also included for both the thruster and aerospike so that efficiencies
  and comparisons may be made.
