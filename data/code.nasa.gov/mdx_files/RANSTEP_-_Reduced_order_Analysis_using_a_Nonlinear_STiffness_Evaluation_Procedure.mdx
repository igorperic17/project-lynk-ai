description: A new implementation of reduced order finite-element-based analysis for
  solving geometrically nonlinear random vibration problems of complex structures
  has been developed.  The implementation is given the acronym RANSTEP for Reduced
  order Analysis using a Nonlinear STiffness Evaluation Procedure.  The nonlinear
  stiffness evaluation procedure allows computation of otherwise inaccessible modal
  nonlinear stiffness terms from commercial finite element programs.  Some operations
  are performed outside the commercial codes and utilize in-house developed FORTRAN
  codes.  Additionally Direct Matrix Abstraction Program (DMAP) alters and PYTHON
  scripts are used to facilitate implementations written about MSC.NASTRAN and ABAQUS,
  respectively.  Two solutions procedures of different fidelity and computational
  cost are offered in each implementation.  They are equivalent linearization and
  time numerical simulation. Aerospace uses include aircraft and spacecraft structural
  analysis.
