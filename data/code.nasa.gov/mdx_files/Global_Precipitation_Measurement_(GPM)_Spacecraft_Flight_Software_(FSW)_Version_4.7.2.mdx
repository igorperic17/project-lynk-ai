description: "The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) spacecraft (S/C) flight software\
  \ (FSW) controls and coordinates all aspects of the spacecraft's operation in nominal\
  \ and anomolous conditions.  It distributes commands to, and collects data from,\
  \ all spacecraft subsystems and  the science instruments.  The FSW controls high\
  \ gain antenna pointing to TDRSS satellites and manages communications with the\
  \ ground controllers in real time to receive commands (during SSA contacts) and\
  \ send housekeeping telemetry data during SSA and MA contacts.  It sends science\
  \ data using the Class-2 CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP).  The GPM FSW monitors\
  \ the health of  most orbiter subsystems and takes corrective actions when necessary.\
  \  \r\nThe GPM FSW controls the pointing of the spacecraft/instruments to the earth's\
  \ surface, the orientation of the solar arrays to collect power,  and the pointing\
  \ of the high gain antenna to communicate with TDRSS.   The GPM FSW uses the propulsion\
  \ system to perform orbit station keeping and re-entry upon mission completion.\
  \  The GPM FSW also implements a safehold controller and can perform \"yaw maneuvers\"\
  \ to re-orient the spacecraft velocity vector by 180 degrees.\r\nThe GPM FSW uses\
  \ Goddard's Operating System Abstration Layer (OSAL) and the Core Flight Executive\
  \ (cFE) software. Ten Core Flight System (CFS) applications were co-developed by\
  \ GPM and Code 582 and are now available in the Code 582 library for future mission\
  \ use.\r\n"
