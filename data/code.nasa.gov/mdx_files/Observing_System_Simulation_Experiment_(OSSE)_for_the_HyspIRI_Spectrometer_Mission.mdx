description: 'This software is for the optimal instrument design for Earth-observing
  missions that depend on the complicated interplay between atmospheric radiative
  transfer, surface characteristics, orbital geometry, retrieval algorithms, and science
  objectives. It accomplishes this by implementing an Observing System Simulation
  Environment (OSSE) and is used to demonstrate science return for proposed instruments
  by modeling the whole ground truth, sensing, and retrieval chain. '
