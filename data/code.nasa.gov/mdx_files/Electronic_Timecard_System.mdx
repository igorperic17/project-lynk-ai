description: The Electronic Timecard System can be utilized by any business or organization
  wishing to streamline its payroll department procedures. The automated system minimizes
  the consumption of paper and eliminates the need for weekly pick-up and delivery
  of time sheets. The tool also simplifies the daily recording of time worked by employees,
  and it allows employees to "sign" their "timecards" electronically at the end of
  each week. Supervisors can review an employee's electronic timecards daily and sign
  them electronically.
