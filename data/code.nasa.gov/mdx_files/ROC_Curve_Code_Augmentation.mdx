description: ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve Code Augmentation is a
  modification of ROC Curve code originally authored by G.C. Cawley that provides
  additional functionality. The inclusion of more detailed bookkeeping of new and
  existing internal data structures that provide more visibility into various performance
  measures is one of the new features.
