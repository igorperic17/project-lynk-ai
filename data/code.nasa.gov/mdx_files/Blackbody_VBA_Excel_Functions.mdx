description: In the analysis of radiation, it is helpful to be able to predict the
  heat transfer rate and the spectral distribution of the emitted energy. Presented
  here is a set of routines written in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)
  and incorporating functions specific to Microsoft Excel that are useful for predicting
  the radiative behavior of heated surfaces. These routines include functions for
  calculating important engineering quantities of primary importance to engineers
  and scientists such as radiative flux and spectral distributions. In addition, the
  routines also provide the capability to use such information to determine surface
  temperatures from spectral intensities and for calculating the sensitivity of these
  temperature measurements to unknowns in the input parameters.
