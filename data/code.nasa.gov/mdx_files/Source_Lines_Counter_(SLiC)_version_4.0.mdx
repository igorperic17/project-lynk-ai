description: 'SLiC has been used in a variety of projects and missions at JPL, with
  over 75 active users at JPL alone. It is the official code counter endorsed by the
  Software Quality Improvement Project for its metrics collections effort across JPL
  and SQIs most requested software product. SLiC provides data for cost models used
  during all major JPL pre-Phase A software estimation activities as well as cost
  validation activities throughout project lifecycles. SLiC is used to gather metrics
  for the JPL State of Software report to measure process trends in flight projects
  and multimission ground system services. '
