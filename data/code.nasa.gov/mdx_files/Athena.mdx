description: 'One of the big efforts of NASA is the observation of planet earth from
  space. Global climate change is a prime example. Extending Athena from the county
  level to the global level would give a simulation tool for examining how populations
  and countries might respond to global cllimate change and/or new policies related
  to controlling climate change. '
