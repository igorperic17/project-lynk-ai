description: Structural Analysis Routines (STARS) is an efficient, cost-effective,
  and unique computer program that analyzes a variety of practical engineering problems.
  The software is a fully integrated, multidisciplinary, finite-element-based, graphic-oriented
  analysis tool that combines individual modules to solve complex engineering problems.
  STARS can be used for a range of applications, including structural analysis, heat
  transfer, linear aerodynamics, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as well as
  coupled linear and CFD-based (aeroelastic, aeroacoustic, and aerothermoelastic)
  acoustics and aeroservoelastic analysis. Because of the tool's highly integrated
  nature, it has broad application across many engineering disciplines.
