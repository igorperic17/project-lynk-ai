description: Earth-Gram 2010 is an open-source Fortran computer code that can run
  on a variety of platforms including PCs and UNIX stations. The model provides values
  for atmospheric parameters such as density, temperature, winds, and constituents
  for any month and at any altitude and location within the Earth's atmosphere. Versions
  from 1999 and 2007 are also available.
