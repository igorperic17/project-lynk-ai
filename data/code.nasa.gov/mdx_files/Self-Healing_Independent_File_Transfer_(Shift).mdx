description: Shift is a lightweight framework for high performance local and remote
  file transfers that provides resiliency across a wide variety of failure scenarios
  through various techniques. These include end-to-end integrity via cryptographic
  hashes, throttling of transfers to prevent resource exhaustion, balancing transfers
  across resources based on load and availability, and parallelization of transfers
  across multiple source and destination hosts for increased redundancy and performance.
