description: MYSTRAN is a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) processor.   MYSTRAN takes
  NASTRAN data decks as input and processes them to generate results files based on
  the inputs.   NASTRAN was originally developed at NASA GSFC in the 1960's.   The
  input files describe the mechanical nature of some piece of hardware and the loads
  or driving inputs that cause some reaction.   With this input MYSTRAN computes the
  responses to the driving inputs.  The theory and research for FEA analysis has been
  developed over decades.
