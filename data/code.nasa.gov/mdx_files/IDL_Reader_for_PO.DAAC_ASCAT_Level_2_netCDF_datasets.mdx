description: This PO.DAAC provided program reads a specific ASCSAT Level 2 netCDF
  file by first ensuring that the file is gzipped. The main program then reads all
  netCDF data variables in to memory and passes this data to a subroutine that applies
  scaling to data variables and decomposition of quality flag information. The subroutine
  also provides index-based subsetting with user-specified along-track and cross-track
  grid cell indexing. Lastly, the subroutine converts the seconds from the time variable
  in to a human readable time of day based upon ISO-8601 date/time standards.
