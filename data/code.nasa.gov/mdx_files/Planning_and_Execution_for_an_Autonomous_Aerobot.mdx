description: The software provides onboard planning and execution technologies to
  provide robust and opportunistic mission operations for an aerobot. The planning
  and execution component of AerOASIS is able to generate mission operations plans
  that achieve science and engineering objectives while respecting mission and resource
  constraints as well as adapt the plan to respond to new science opportunities. Onboard
  planning and scheduling for an aerobot is a new capability.
