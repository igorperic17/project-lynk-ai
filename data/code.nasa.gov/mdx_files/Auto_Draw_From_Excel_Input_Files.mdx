description: The software  allows visualization of complex data in a format that is
  more easily understandable than pages of numbers. Because the graphical output can
  be updated automatically, the manual labor of diagram drawing can be eliminated.
  The more frequent update of system diagrams can reduce confusion and reduce errors
  and is likely to uncover symmetric problems earlier in the design cycle, thus reducing
  rework and redesign.
