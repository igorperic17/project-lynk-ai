description: The Agile ISRU Demo Plant Sizing Tool will provide a rough parametric
  estimate of ISRU plant mass and power requirements based on fitting data to a heritage
  curve. NEO, Phobos, Lunar Surface, and Martian Surface are included at a notional
  level within this system that allows architecture designers to roughly scale ISRU
  plants before talking to specialists.
