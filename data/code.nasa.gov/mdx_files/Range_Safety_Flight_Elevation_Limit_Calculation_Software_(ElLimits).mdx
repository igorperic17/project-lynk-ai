description: The ElLimits program is used to configure launch-phase range safety flight
  control lines for guided missiles. The user specifies the extents and resolution
  of a grid in the vertical plane oriented along the launch azimuth. At each grid
  point, the program computes the maximum velocity vector flight elevation that can
  be permitted without endangering a specified back-range location. Vertical plane
  x-y limit lines are derived from the flight elevation limit data by numerically
  propagating "streamlines" through the grid.
