description: NASAaccess is R package that can generate gridded ascii tables of climate
  (CIMP5) and weather data (GPM, TRMM, GLDAS) needed to drive various hydrological
  models (e.g., SWAT, VIC, RHESSys, ..etc). The package assumes that users have already
  set up a registration account(s) with Earthdata login as well as authorizing NASA
  GESDISC data access. Please refer to  https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/data-access for
  further details. The package relies on 'curl' (https://curl.haxx.se/) commands and
  library to access and download data from NASA remote sensing servers.  Since Mac
  users have curl as part of macOS, Windows users should make sure that their local
  machines have 'curl' installed properly.  Creating the .netrc file at the user machine
  'Home' directory and storing the user NASA GESDISC logging information in it is
  needed to execute the package commands. Instructions on creating the .netrc and
  .urs_cookies files can be accessed at https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/EL/How+To+Access+Data+With+cURL+And+Wget.
