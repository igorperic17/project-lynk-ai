description: TD2 performs a streamline analysis that can use meridional velocity gradients
  to control the radial distribution of work and flow for multistage, multishaft,
  cooled/uncooled axial-flow turbines. The effects of streamline slope and curvature
  are included in the radial equilibrium. Hub and tip radii are specified at inlet,
  at exit, and between each blade row, and velocity diagrams for each stage can be
  individually controlled. An internal loss correction determines blade-row total-pressure-loss
  coefficients along the streamlines.
