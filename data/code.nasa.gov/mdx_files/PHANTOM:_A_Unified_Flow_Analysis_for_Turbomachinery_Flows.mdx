description: PHANTOM is a unified, three-dimensional, unsteady Navier-Stokes analysis
  used for solving flows in rotating turbomachinery components operating in liquids
  or gases. Working fluids could be air, liquid or gaseous hydrogen, liquid or gaseous
  oxygen, kerosene, or others. The flow may be incompressible (e.g., a fuel pump in
  a liquid-fueled rocket engine) or compressible (e.g., the turbine that drives that
  fuel pump).
