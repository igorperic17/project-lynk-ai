description: FIAT v3 simulates one-dimensional thermal energy transport in a multilayer
  stack of isotropic materials and structures that can ablate from the front surface
  and decompose in depth.  The implicit solution algorithm and general solution technique
  make the program very stable and robust for application to both robotic and crewed
  vehicles entering a planetary atmosphere from space.  For input, the code reads
  material property information from a database file.
