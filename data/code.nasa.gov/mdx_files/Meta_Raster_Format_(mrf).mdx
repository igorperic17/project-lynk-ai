description: The source code contains the Meta Raster Format (MRF) specification and
  plugin for GDAL, which is a part of the OnEarth software package. OnEarth consists
  of image formatting and serving modules which facilitate the deployment of a web
  service capable of efficiently serving standards-based requests for georeferenced
  raster imagery at multiple spatial resolutions including, but not limited to, full
  spatial resolution. The Meta Raster Format and OnEarth software were originally
  developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to serve global daily composites
  of MODIS imagery. Since then, it has been deployed and repurposed in other installations,
  including at the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC)
  in support of the State of the Oceans (SOTO) visualization tool, the Lunar Mapping
  and Modeling Project (LMMP), and GIBS.
