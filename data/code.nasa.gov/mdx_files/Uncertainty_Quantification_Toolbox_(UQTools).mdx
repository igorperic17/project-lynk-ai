description: UQTools is a MATLAB-based software package designed to efficiently analyze
  dynamic systems subject to parametric uncertainty. UQTools accepts uncertainty models
  based upon both probabilistic and non-probabilistic definitions, and it realizes
  several complementary methods for performing a variety of uncertainty quantification
  tasks.
