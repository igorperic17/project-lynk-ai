description: The Goddard Dynamic Simulator (GDS) is used to test both software and
  hardware flight systems. GDS software integrates the dynamics equations of motion
  for a spacecraft, models environmental forces acting on the spacecraft, models spacecraft
  components such as reaction wheels, thrusters, star trackers, other actuators and
  sensors, and instruments.
