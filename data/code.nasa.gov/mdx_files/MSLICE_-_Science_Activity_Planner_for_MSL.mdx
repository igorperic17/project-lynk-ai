description: "MSLICE has been tasked to fulfill a challenging set of requirements.\
  \  To meet these requirements, MSLICE delivers a rich feature set which includes\
  \ but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n1) Simple, intuitive, and powerful search capability.\
  \  For any given mission there is a huge amount of data and associated metadata\
  \ that is generated.  Quickly and easily sifting through all the data to find the\
  \ interesting products requires a powerful tool with an intuitive interface.  MSLICE\
  \ provides such an interface in much the same way that the major Internet search\
  \ engines provide a tool for searching the internet.\r\n2) Visualization of the\
  \ rover's traverse in a HiRISE image.  This view is basically a map of the mission,\
  \ and it allows scientists to easily gauge where the rover has been and where they\
  \ would like it to go.  The map also provides the ability to correct or adjust the\
  \ known position of the rover through the technique of overlaying images acquired\
  \ from the rover on top of the HiRISE image.  A user can then correct the rover's\
  \ position by collocating the visible features in the overlays with the same features\
  \ in the underlying HiRISE image.\r\n3) Visualization of data products and the ability\
  \ to view mosaics."
