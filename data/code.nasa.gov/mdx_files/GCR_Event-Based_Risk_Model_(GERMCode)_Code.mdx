description: "The GERMCode provides scientists data interpretation of experiments;\
  \ modeling of beam line, shielding of target samples and sample holders; and estimation\
  \ of basic physical and biological outputs of their experiments.\r\nFor mono-energetic\
  \ ion beams, basic physical and biological properties are calculated for a selected\
  \ ion type, such as kinetic energy, mass, charge number, absorbed dose, or fluence.\
  \  Evaluated quantities are linear energy transfer (LET), range (R), absorption\
  \ and fragmentation cross sections, and the probability of nuclear interactions\
  \ after 1 or 5 cm of water equivalent material.  In addition, a set of biophysical\
  \ properties are evaluated, such as, the Poisson distribution for a specified cellular\
  \ area, cell survival curves, and DNA damage yields per cell.\r\n\r\n Also, the\
  \ GERM code calculates the radiation transport of the beam line for either a fixed\
  \ number of user specified depths or at multiple positions along the Bragg curve\
  \ of the particle in a selected material. \r\n"
