description: The RTD code executes a conceptual design for a single-stage radial-inflow
  turbine. A mean-line analysis is performed for the locations having constant radius
  over the blade span. Constant span-fraction sectors are used at the rotor exit.
  The analysis can account for stator end-wall clearance flow and swept rotor blades.
  The loss model includes stator and rotor passage losses, trailing-edge losses, vaneless
  space loss, disk-friction loss, and rotor-exit clearance loss.
