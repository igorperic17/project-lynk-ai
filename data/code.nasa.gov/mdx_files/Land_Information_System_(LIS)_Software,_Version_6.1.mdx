description: 'LIS can be used (1) as a problem-solving environment for hydrologic
  research to enable accurate global water- and energy-cycle predictions, or (2) as
  a decision support system to generate useful information for disaster, water resource,
  and agricultural management; numerical weather prediction; and air quality and military
  mobility assessment. Extensible interfaces allow the incorporation of new domains,
  land surface parameters, meteorological inputs, data assimilation, and optimization
  algorithms. Please visit the following URL for more information: http://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/'
