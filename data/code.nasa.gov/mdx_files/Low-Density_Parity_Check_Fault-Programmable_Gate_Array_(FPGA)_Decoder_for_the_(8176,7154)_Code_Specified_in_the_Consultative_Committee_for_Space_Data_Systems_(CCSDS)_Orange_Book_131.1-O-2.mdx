description: VHDL code has been written to implement the (8176,7154) LDPC code in
  the CCSDS Orange Book 131.1-O-2. The design has been tested using a Virtex 4 LX200
  FGPA running at 66 MHz for various signal-to-noise ratios with on-chip random normal
  generators. The decoder core will run at 100 MHz giving a sustained throughput of
  650 Mbits/second. The decoder uses the minimum sum algorithm with an attenuation
  multiplier of 0.75 and 6-bit saturating arithmetic. The decoder does 14 iterations
  per block and generates a dot product for the last iteration. Data is input and
  output as 7-bit probabilities of 6 bits each per cycle.
