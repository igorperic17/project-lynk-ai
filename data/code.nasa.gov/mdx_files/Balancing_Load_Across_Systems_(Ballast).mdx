description: Ballast is a tool for balancing user load across SSH servers based on
  configurable criteria such as CPU load and system availability. Ballast is invoked
  as part of the SSH login process, hence has access to the user name, which is not
  available in traditional load balancers. This gives ballast the unique ability to
  perform user-specific load balancing, which has several benefits including separating
  users who have historically generated high loads and providing a common login interface
  to users who may be separated based on other criteria such as system accessibility.
  Ballast includes a simple client, a lightweight data server, and a data collection
  agent.
