description: ACD is an analysis code used for the aerodynamic design of multistage
  axial-flow compressors. The technology provides velocity diagrams on the streamlines
  at the blade-row edges. Blade elements are defined by centerline curve and thickness
  distribution, and blade-element inlet and outlet angles are established through
  empirical incidence and deviation-angle adjustments to the velocity diagrams. Blade
  elements can be stacked to provide the full blade design.
