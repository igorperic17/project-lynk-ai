description: One-class nu-Support Vector machine (SVMs) learning technique maps the
  input data into a much higher dimensional space and then uses a small portion of
  the training data (support vectors) to parametrize the decision surface that can
  linearly separate nu fraction of training points (labeled as anomalies) from the
  rest.
