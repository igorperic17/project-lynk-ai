description: This innovation creates the capability for Fortran software developers
  to routinely declare and use specialized software containers for arbitrary types
  of data. The capability is somewhat analogous to that of the C Standard Template
  Library but with important differences. Although the number of containers are expected
  to grow, the current supported cases are Vector, Map, and Set. Contained items can
  be of any intrinsic type or user-defined derived type. The user can also indicate
  that the contained objects are polymorphic and/or pointers with corresponding implications
  for the semantics of using those containers.
