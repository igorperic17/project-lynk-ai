description: TThe IDL Astronomy Library contains four different sets of procedures
  for reading, writing, and modifying FITS files. The reason for having four different
  methods of FITS I/O with IDL is partly historical, as different groups developed
  the software independently. However, each method also has its own strengths and
  weakness for any particular task. For example, the procedure MRDFITS() -- which
  can read a FITS table into an IDL structure --is the easiest procedure for analyzing
  FITS files at the IDL prompt level (provided that one is comfortable with IDL structures).
  But mapping a table into an IDL structure includes extra overhead, so that when
  performing FITS I/O at the procedure level, it may be desirable to use more efficient
  procedures such as FITS_READ and FTAB_EXT.
