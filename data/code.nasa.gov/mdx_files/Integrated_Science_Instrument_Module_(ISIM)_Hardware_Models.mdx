description: 'The Integrated Science Instrument Models (ISIM) hardware models are
  Wind River Simics Device Modeling Language (DML) models for the ISIM Command and
  Data Handling (ICDH) electrical components;  Housekeeping card (HK), Bus Interface
  Card (BIC), and Focal Plane Array Processor (FPAPs).  The models allow the ISIM
  flight software to be executed within a COTS emulator product, Wind River Simics.  This
  technology was primarily developed under the NASA IV&V Chief Engineer Support contract
  with contributions from the 2013 GSFC Software Simulations for Spacecraft Development
  IRAD (HK model and verification work) to support JWST IV&V work.  '
