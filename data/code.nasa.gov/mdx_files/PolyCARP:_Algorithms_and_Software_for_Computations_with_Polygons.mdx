description: PolyCARP is a package of algorithms, including both their formal models
  and software implementations, for computing containment, collision, resolution,
  and recovery information for polygons. The intended applications of PolyCARP are
  related, but not limited, to safety critical systems in air traffic management.
  One application is weather avoidance. A weather cell can be approximated by a polygon,
  and PolyCARP provides algorithms to detect whether a trajectory will intersect such
  a polygon in the near future and will provide maneuver guidance to avoid the polygon.
  If the trajectory is inside the polygon at the current time, PolyCARP provides algorithms
  for maneuver guidance to exit the polygon. Another application is ensuring that
  an aircraft stays inside a predetermined safety region, also known as assured containment,
  and PolyCARP provides algorithms that ensure that a point is inside or outside a
  particular polygonal region. Another application is obstacle avoidance by an aircraft.
  There are several functionalities provided by PolyCARP. There are algorithms to
  insure that a point is contained in or excluded from a polygon. There are also collision
  detection algorithms that determine if a moving point intersects a polygon, including
  the case where the polygon is moving or even warping over time, as well as where
  the polygon and the point are following piecewise linear trajectories. There are
  algorithms that resolve potential collisions between and point and a polygon by
  providing collision-free trajectories, and there are algorithms that compute new
  trajectories to regain separation from a polygon.
