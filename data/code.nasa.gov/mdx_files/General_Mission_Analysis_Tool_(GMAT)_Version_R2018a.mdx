description: The General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) is the world's only enterprise,
  multi-mission, open source software system for space mission design, optimization,
  and navigation. The system supports missions in flight regimes ranging from low
  Earth orbit to lunar, libration point, and deep space missions. GMAT is developed
  by a team of NASA, private industry, public, and private contributors and is used
  for real-world mission support, engineering studies, as a tool for education, and
  public engagement.
