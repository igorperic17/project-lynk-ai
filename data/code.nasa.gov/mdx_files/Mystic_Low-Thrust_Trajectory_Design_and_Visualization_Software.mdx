description: Mystic provides very high-fidelity optimization of low-thrust spacecraft
  trajectories for mission design. The software can be used for general body-centered
  trajectories, interplanetary trajectories, and trajectories that combine body-centered
  and interplanetary trajectory legs. Mystic will also provide navigational/operational
  support for low-thrust spacecraft.
