description: This NASA Online Directives Information System (NODIS) application interfaces
  with the Johnson Space Center (JSC) search appliance to display a listing of all
  documents derived from NASA Policy Directives (NPDs), NASA Procedural Requirements
  (NPRs), and NASA memos that contain the term "center director." The tool allows
  the user to click on a document link and view a listing of all directives contained
  in the selected document and also view detailed information for each directive.
  The application provides an Excel report of "accepted" directives.
