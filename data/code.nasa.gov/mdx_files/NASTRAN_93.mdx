description: NASTRAN is the NASA Structural Analysis System, a finite element analysis
  program (FEA) completed in the early 1970's. It was the first of its kind and opened
  the door to computer-aided engineering. Subsections of a design can be modeled and
  then larger groupings of these elements can again be modeled. NASTRAN can handle
  elastic stability analysis, complex eigenvalues for vibration and dynamic stability
  analysis, dynamic response for transient and steady state loads, and random excitation,
  and static response to concentrated and distributed loads, thermal expansion, and
  enforced deformations.
