description: "Hazards and Population Mapper (HazPop) is a free app Developed by the\
  \ NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC). The App enables users\
  \ to easily display recent natural hazard data in relationship to population, major\
  \ infrastructure, and satellite imagery. Hazards data include the location of active\
  \ fires over the past 48 hours; earthquake alerts over the past seven days; and\
  \ yesterdays air pollution data measured from space. The app shows the location\
  \ of major dams and nuclear power plants and provides more detailed information\
  \ and imagery for these facilities where available. By drawing a circle around a\
  \ point or area of interest on the map, users can obtain an estimate of the total\
  \ population and land area enclosed within.\r\n\r\n"
