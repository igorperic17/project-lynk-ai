description: The Simple Subset Wizard (SSW) makes searching for granules easier. The
  tool unites the search function with various subsetters to deliver a single, simple,
  seamless process. SSW uses OpenSearch to query the Earth Observing System Clearing
  House (ECHO) for granules and then employs individual subset agents to submit requests.
  The SSW currently has 11 agents to interface with different subsetters, which support
  the subsetting of 217  EOSDIS data sets.   The SSW provides the capability to subset
  by either temporal range or spatial region, although not all subsetters have both
  of these capabilities.
