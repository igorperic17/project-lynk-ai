description: 'The long-term evolution characteristics (and stability) of an orbit
  are best charac-terized using a mean element propagation of the perturbed two body
  variational equations of motion. The averaging process eliminates short period terms
  leaving only secular and long period effects. In this software a non-traditional
  approach is taken that averages the variational equations using adaptive numerical
  techniques and then numerically integrating the resulting EOMs. Doing this avoids
  the Fourier series expansions and truncations required by the traditional analytic
  methods. The resultant numerical techniques can be easily adapted to propagations
  at most solar system bodies. '
