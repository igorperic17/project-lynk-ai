description: 'The Planetary Image Geometry (PIG) library is a multimission library
  used for projecting images (EDR''s, or Experiment Data Records) and managing their
  geometry. A collection of models describe cameras and their articulation, allowing
  application programs such as mosaickers, terrain generators, and pointing correction
  tools to be written in a multimission manner, without any knowledge of parameters
  specific to the supported missions. '
