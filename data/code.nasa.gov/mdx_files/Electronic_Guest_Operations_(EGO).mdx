description: Electronic Guest Operations (EGO) has been used as an all-encompassing
  electronic guest management system for tracking guest invitations/RSVPs to Space
  Shuttle launches, landings, and receptions. The tool serves as a single application
  that will maintain guest and mission information, run standard reports, email guests,
  produce mailing labels, and export data. Via the Internet, invited guests can access
  EGO Web pages from all over the world to register their attendance intentions, access
  relevant mission data, and update their contact information. After guest registration,
  administrative support personnel have used EGO to maintain guest-seating assignments,
  send email communications, maintain attendance to special receptions, and gather
  security information for foreign guests. EGO replaces a very paper-intensive process,
  saves a significant amount in postage costs, and reduces error-prone data entry.
  The tool has been built with flexibility and customization in mind. Its initial
  scope was broadened to also serve as the login for people invited to view an International
  Space Station Friends and Family Web site created by Wyle Life Sciences. The Constellation
  program also used EGO to invite guests to attend the Pad Abort (PA-1) test flight
  in 2010.
