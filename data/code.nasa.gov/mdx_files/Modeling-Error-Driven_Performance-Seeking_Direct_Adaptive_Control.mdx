description: This software uses a novel, stable, discrete, time-adaptive law that
  implements flight control to target damages/modeling errors in a direct adaptive-control
  framework. The baseline controller uses dynamic inversion with proportional integral
  augmentation. This methodology will investigate conditions for stability as well
  as performance.
