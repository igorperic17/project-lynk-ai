description: 'NLAS maximizes the efficiency of satellite launch opportunities. The
  technology acts as a "spacer" between the rocket and the primary spacecraft. NLAS
  consists of three main subsystems: the Adapter, the Dispenser, and the Deployment
  Sequencer. Each subsystem can be configured to meet the specific needs of a given
  launch.'
