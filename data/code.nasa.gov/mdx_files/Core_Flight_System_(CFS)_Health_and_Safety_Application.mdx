description: The plug-and-play CFS Health and Safety application is compatible with
  the Core Flight Executive (cFE) and uses the Operating System Abstraction Layer
  (OSAL), both of which were developed by Goddard Space Flight Center in order to
  provide a reusable, platform-independent, mission-independent, layered architecture
  for hosting applications. The technology can be used for any government or commercial
  spacecraft.
