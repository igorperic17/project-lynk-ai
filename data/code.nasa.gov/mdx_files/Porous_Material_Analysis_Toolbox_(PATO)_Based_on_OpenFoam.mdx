description: "The Porous material Analysis Toolbox (PATO) is a modular analysis platform\
  \ for multiphase porous reactive materials. It can be run as a simple Fourier heat\
  \ transfer code or include more advanced features as internal decomposition (pyrolysis,\
  \ vaporization), gas-gas and gas-solid chemical interactions (combustion, cracking,\
  \ coking), gas species transport (convection, diffusion), and solid morphology evolutions\
  \ (internal density changes, surface ablation).\r\nPATO is implemented as a C++\
  \  top level module of the open source (GNU GPL) computational fluid dynamics software\
  \ program OpenFOAM. This offering is not approved or endorsed by OpenCFD Limited,\
  \ the producer of the OpenFOAM software and owner of the OPENFOAM and OpenCFD trademarks.\
  \ PATO also uses the open source (GNU LGPL) thermodynamics, transport, and chemistry\
  \ library Mutation++ produced by the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics.\r\n"
