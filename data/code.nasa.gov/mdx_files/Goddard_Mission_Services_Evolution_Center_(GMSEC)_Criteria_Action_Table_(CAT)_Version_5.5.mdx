description: The Criteria Action Table is a real-time decision-making component.  Using
  predefined criteria (rules), CAT will ingest messages in real-time, analyze the
  content and context, and determine if the predefined criteria has been met.  If
  so, an associated set of predefined actions is automatically triggered.  Pre-defined
  actions can also be disabled.  A decision-making, action-triggering component, such
  as CAT, can contribute to system-wide situational awareness, provide system-wide
  process orchestration, and enable system automation.
