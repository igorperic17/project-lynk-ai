description: "Tool for Analysis of Surface Cracks (TASC) is a computer program created\
  \ in MATLAB to enable easy computation of nonlinear J-integral solutions for surface\
  \ cracked plates in tension by accessing and interpolating between the 600 nonlinear\
  \ surface crack solutions documented in NASA/TP-2011-217480. The only required inputs\
  \ are the surface crack dimensions (2c and a), plate cross-section dimensions (W\
  \ and B), and linear plus power law material properties of elastic modulus, yield\
  \ strength, and strain hardening coefficient. With the geometry and material parameters\
  \ entered, TASC interpolates to the appropriate J(\u03A6) vs. crack mouth opening\
  \ displacement (CMOD) and far-field tension stress, \u03C3, vs. CMOD solution, providing\
  \ the full solution as CMOD ranges from zero out to the CMOD limit of the solution\
  \ space for the given input parameters. TASC was developed by the Material and Processes\
  \ Laboratory at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center."
