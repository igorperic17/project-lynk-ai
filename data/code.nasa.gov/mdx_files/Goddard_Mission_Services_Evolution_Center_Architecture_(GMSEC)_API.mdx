description: The Goddard Mission Services Evolution Center (GMSEC) program was established
  in 2001 to coordinate ground data systems development and services at GSFC with
  the ultimate goal to efficiently support current and future GSFC mission services.
  The GMSEC architecture is a ground systems architecture that spans the full mission
  lifecycle from development through operations. The architecture provides a secure,
  scalable and extensible communications and data system that supports all aspects
  of a mission from onboard processing through the Mission Operations Center (MOC)
  to public access on the Internet. The architecture includes an Application Programming
  Interface (API) and message bus to provide a publish and subscribe communication
  mechanism. The GMSEC architecture and source code are based on an enterprise architecture
  approach with a message-oriented cross-platform enterprise middleware (information
  software bus).
