description: The T-NASA suite is composed of a collection of computer programs and
  libraries that enable the real-time simulation of head-up, out-the-window, and head-down
  moving map displays. The technology currently runs on a distributed IRIX system
  using the Performer graphics libraries and the X Windows graphical user interface.
