description: OnEarth is a software package consisting of image formatting and serving
  modules which facilitate the deployment of a web service capable of efficiently
  serving standards-based requests for georeferenced raster imagery at multiple spatial
  resolutions including, but not limited to, full spatial resolution. The software
  was originally developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to serve global
  daily composites of MODIS imagery. Since then, it has been deployed and repurposed
  in other installations, including at the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active
  Archive Center (PO.DAAC) in support of the State of the Oceans (SOTO) visualization
  tool, the Lunar Mapping and Modeling Project (LMMP), and Worldview.
