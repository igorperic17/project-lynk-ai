description: 'Damian Eads (at Los Alamos at that time) wrote a MatLab interface to
  the CFITSIO library using a tool called ''mex''. MFITSIO supports reading and writing
  FITS images, image subsets, and headers. (UPDATE, June 2013: MFITSIO is no longer
  available from the Los Alamos web site, however, the last version (1.2.4) of the
  MFITSIO source code .tar file has been retrieved from the Internet Archive WayBack
  Machine and made available here. The mfitsio interface has not been maintained for
  many years, and some users have reported problems with installing the software.)'
