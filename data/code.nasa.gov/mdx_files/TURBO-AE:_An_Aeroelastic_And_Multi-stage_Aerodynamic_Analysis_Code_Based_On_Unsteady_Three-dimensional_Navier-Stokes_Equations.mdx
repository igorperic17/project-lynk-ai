description: An aeroelastic and unsteady aerodynamic analysis code has been developed
  for prediction of flutter, forced response, performance and rotor-stator interaction
  effects. The analysis provides a high-fidelity modeling of subsonic, transonic and
  supersonic flow regimes with attached and separated flow fields. The code calculates
  performance quantities such as efficiency, mass flow, pressure ratio, temperature
  ratio, distribution of flowfield properties in the entire domain of calculation,
  aerodynamic damping to assess flutter stabiltiy and unsteady aerodynamic forces
  arising from rotor-stator interaction for calculation of forced response. This information
  can be used in high cycle fatigue analysis of blade rows.
