description: The NASA Root Cause Analysis Tool (RCAT) has been designed to facilitate
  the analysis of anomalies, close calls, and accidents and also identify the appropriate
  corrective actions to prevent recurrence. The software provides an analyst with
  a quick, easy-to-use, accurate, and repeatable method to perform and document root
  cause analysis, identify corrective actions, perform trending analysis, and generate
  usable data for probabilistic risk assessment. All possible causes of accidents-hardware,
  software, the environment, weather, natural phenomena, external events, human error-can
  be incorporated into the timeline and fault/causal factor trees. The software features
  an intuitive logic diagramming capability and uses standard terminology, definitions,
  and symbols.
