description: The Fast Scattering Code (FSC) is a computer program designed to predict
  the scattered acoustic field that results from the interaction between a known incident
  sound and arbitrary three-dimensional surfaces immersed in a potential background
  flow. The technology is based on the equations of time-harmonic, linearized acoustics
  and employs equivalent sources for solving an exterior Helmholtz equation boundary
  value problem (BVP). The incident sound can be generated by the FSC using a collection
  of simple point multipoles (monopoles and dipoles), or it can be provided by the
  user from other prediction codes. Predictions for high-frequency/large scale-combinations
  yield linear systems with millions of unknowns and memory requirements beyond the
  capabilities of most advanced computer systems to date. The computational engine
  of the FSC has been totally redesigned to alleviate the frequency limitations of
  the code by employing numerical algorithms that drastically reduce computer resource
  utilization and take advantage of multiprocessor platforms.
