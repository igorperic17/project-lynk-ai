description: 'TPM determines the differential omnidirectional proton flux from 1 to
  100 MeV. At high altitudes, the model is based on CRRESPRO developed by AFRL; at
  low altitudes, the model is based on data from the TIROS/NOAA (POES) low-altitude
  polar-orbiting satellites. The model contains a true solar cycle variation and also
  contains sub-models for quiet and active magnetospheric states. '
