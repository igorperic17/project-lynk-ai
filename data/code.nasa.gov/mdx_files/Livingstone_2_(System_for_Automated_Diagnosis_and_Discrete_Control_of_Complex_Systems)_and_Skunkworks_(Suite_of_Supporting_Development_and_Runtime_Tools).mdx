description: Livingstone 2 is a reusable artificial intelligence (AI) software system
  designed to assist spacecraft, life support systems, chemical plants, or other complex
  systems in operating robustly with minimal human supervision, even in the face of
  hardware failures or unexpected events. The technology diagnoses the current state
  of a spacecraft or other system and recommends commands or repair actions that will
  allow the system to continue operations. A re-engineered version of the Livingstone
  diagnosis system that was flight-tested onboard the Deep Space One spacecraft in
  1999, Livingstone 2 contains significant enhancements to robustness, performance,
  and usability. Skunkworks is a suite of software tools that support the rapid deployment
  of model-based representations of complex systems for Livingstone2 via a visual
  model builder/tester and two graphical user interface tools that provide status
  information during testing.
