description: The Piping Stress Analysis Software calculates the stress, working pressure,
  or required pipe-wall thickness for a given application in a simple, straightforward
  manner. The program allows the user to select a specific material from a database
  of commonly used materials or to create a customized database for an unlisted material.
  Pipes can be analyzed according to several sets of requirements, including the ASME/ANSI
  B31.1 and B31.3 piping codes and the JIC hydraulics code. Both standard and SI metric
  versions are available.
