description: This tool is intended to support mission architecture designers design
  simple orbits for vehicles entering into sphere of influence of a planet from heliocentric
  space. It allows architects to put in information about the dV or C3 energy state
  and provide information about the desired parking orbit. From either C3 or dV, it
  calculates the remainder dV required to take the vehicle and place it in the desired
  orbit based on the planet and its sphere of influence.
