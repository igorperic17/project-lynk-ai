description: Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features are used to model the
  texture in CTX images. Local image intensity statistics are also extracted from
  the CTX images. The geomorphology of the underlying terrain is also taken into account
  by using the geomorphic maps produced by geologists during the landing site selection
  process. The statistical relationship between CTX image features, geomorphology
  and rock density is learned by incorporating HiRISE rock counts and a geomorphic
  map covering the Phoenix landing site as ground truth.
