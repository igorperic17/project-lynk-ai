description: 'Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes are the best error correcting
  codes known for a wide variety of communications applications. Research at JPL over
  the last several years has resulted in the Accumulate, Repeat-by-4, and Jagged Accumulate
  (AR4JA) family of LDPC codes. Nine members of this family have been selected for
  standardization by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS), and
  are under consideration for a variety of spacecraft missions and other projects.
  These codes have three block lengths: 1024, 4096, and 16384 information bits; and
  three code rates: 1/2, 2/3, and 4/5. Encoders and decoders for these codes hav been
  written in the Verilog hardware description language, with exactly equivalent versions
  written in the C and Matlab software programming languages. '
