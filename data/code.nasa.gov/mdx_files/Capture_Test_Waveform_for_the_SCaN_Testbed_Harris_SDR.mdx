description: The Capture Test Waveform is a software application designed for space-based
  reconfigurable radios.  The innovation allows snapshots of a radio's receiver environment
  for any number of objectives, such as interference mitigation or radio frequency
  mapping.  Digital samples are acquired and stored in the radio's memory for processing,
  be that on-board the spacecraft or after download to the ground.  The application
  is labeled "Test waveform" because it does not perform any standard communication
  link functions, such as carrier recovery or demodulation.  Depending on the radio's
  resources and architecture, this application could be run in parallel with a standard
  communications link waveform application.
