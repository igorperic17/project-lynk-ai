description: "EUGEN converts digitized sensor output voltage data to engineering units.\
  \ The tool creates individual processed data files (one file per transducer per\
  \ test run), converting raw voltage to meaningful measurements such as pressure\
  \ or temperature. \r\nEngineering Units are generated by the Low Speed Data Processing\
  \ System (LSDPS) in addition to performing calculated values or parameters at different\
  \ levels in order to provide the customer with the final data product. LSDPS utilizes\
  \ the NIST REFPROPS program to calculate thermo-physical properties over a wide\
  \ range of temperatures and pressures. Use of these programs requires proficiency\
  \ in Linux, C and PV-Wave (separate license required) programming languages and\
  \ bash scripts. A GCC compiler is invoked with the make file in each C code program\
  \ directory. Winplot is the general-purpose plotting utility.\r\nA Developers Guide\
  \ provides specifics on the hardware and software requirements needed to execute\
  \ the tool.\r\n"
