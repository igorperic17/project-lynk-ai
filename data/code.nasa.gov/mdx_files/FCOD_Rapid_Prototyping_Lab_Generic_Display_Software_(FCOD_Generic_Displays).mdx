description: This software permits the user to interact with and understand the user
  interface for a generic "glass" spacecraft cockpit. Based on standards developed
  by NASA for the Orion spacecraft, it simulates various phases of flight and various
  malfunction situations to help users understand operating a spacecraft exclusively
  through computer screens instead of a large number of physical switches, gauges,
  and other controls.
