description: 'The Flightspeed Integral Image Analysis Toolkit (FIIAT) is a C library
  for image processing. It provides basic low-level filtering, texture analysis, and
  subwindow descriptors for applications dealing with image interpretation and object
  recognition. The library is designed with spaceflight applications in mind; specifically,
  it addresses the following requirements: - Ease of integration (minimal external
  dependencies). - Fast real-time operation, using integer arithmetic when possible
  - Written entirely in C - "Mostly static" memory allocation - 8-bit image data.
  This implementation is well-suited for the computational constraints of spaceflight.'
