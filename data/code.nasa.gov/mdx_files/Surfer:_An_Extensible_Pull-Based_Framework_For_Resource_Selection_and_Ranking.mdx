description: Surfer examines the pool of potential grid resources and extracts the
  highest-ranking resources that meet user-specified constraints and preferences.
  The technology has been implemented as a grid service that is compliant with an
  Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OGSI), and it can also be embedded directly into
  Java applications through its application programming interface or into non-java
  applications through its XML-based command-line interface.
