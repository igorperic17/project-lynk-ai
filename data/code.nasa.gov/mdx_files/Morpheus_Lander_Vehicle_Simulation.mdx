description: The Morpheus simulation is a suite of software models which simulate
  the performance of a lander vehicle. The specific vehicle is a terrestrial lander
  used as a "vertical test bed" platform for developing technology and proving hardware
  and software systems for use in space exploration. Morpheus software consists of
  three main components - flight software, ground software, and simulation software.
  While the emphasis in spacecraft development typically tends to be on the flight
  software - that software residing and running on the actual vehicle -- both ground
  and simulation software components are equally essential in developing, testing,
  and operating the craft.
