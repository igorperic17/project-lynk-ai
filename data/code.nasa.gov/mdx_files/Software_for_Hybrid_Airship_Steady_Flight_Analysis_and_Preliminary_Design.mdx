description: 'This software helps designers of hybrid airships to understand the effects
  of aerodynamic and thruster performance on steady-state flight mechanics. The software
  is capable of producing a large number of useful plots and requires only basic geometric,
  mass, and aerodynamic data to describe the vehicle. The resultant plots and plotting
  script are compatible with a widely used and freely available plotting package. '
