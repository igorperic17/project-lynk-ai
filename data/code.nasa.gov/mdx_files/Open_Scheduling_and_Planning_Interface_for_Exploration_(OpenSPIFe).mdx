description: "The Open Scheduling and Planning Interface for Exploration (OpenSPIFe)\
  \ is an integrated planning and scheduling toolkit based on hundreds of hours of\
  \ expert observation, use, and refinement of state-of-the-art planning and scheduling\
  \ technology for several applications within NASA. It was designed from the ground\
  \ up with the needs of the operational user in mind, and it presents unique solutions\
  \ to a number of problems common in other commercial and homegrown systems.\r\n\r\
