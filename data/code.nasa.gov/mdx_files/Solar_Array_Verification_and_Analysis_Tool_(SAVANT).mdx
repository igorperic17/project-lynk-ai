description: The powerful, yet easy-to-use SAVANT quick-engineering code calculates
  the expected radiation damage to solar cells in Earth orbit. The tool contains ten
  types of solar cells and four types of cover glass. Radiation damage calculations
  are based on the Displacement Damage Dose method developed at the Naval Research
  Laboratories.
