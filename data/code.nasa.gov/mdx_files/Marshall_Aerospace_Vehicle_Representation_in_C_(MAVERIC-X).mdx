description: Marshall Aerospace Vehicle Representation in C (MAVERIC-X) is a generic
  low-to-high-fidelity six-degree-of-freedom vehicle flight simulation program that
  facilitates the rapid development of flight simulations for launch vehicles and
  spacecraft. It was designed to accommodate multi-staged vehicles, powered serially
  or in parallel, with multiple engines, tanks, and cargo elements.
