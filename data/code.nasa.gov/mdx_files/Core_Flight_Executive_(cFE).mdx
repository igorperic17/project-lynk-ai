description: The Core Flight Executive (cFE) provides software bus, time, event, executive,
  table, and file services, and it defines the application programming interface (API)
  for each set function. Applications subscribe to cFE services at runtime, making
  system modifications easy. Facilitating rapid prototyping, new applications can
  be compiled, linked, loaded, and started without requiring the entire system to
  be rebuilt.
