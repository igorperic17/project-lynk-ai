description: 'MATLAB software Associated with "Practical Micromechanics of Composite
  Materials" Book.  The intent of the book is to provide both students and practitioners
  with a solid understanding of micromechanics concepts and theories that can be used
  in practice and provide their theoretical underpinnings in a clear and concise manner.
  The power of these theories becomes particularly clear with their application (via
  the MATLAB

  software suite) in multiscale modeling of composites, herein limited to classical
  lamination theory.

  The compilation of scripts and functions enables a user to perform all examples
  and exercises presented in the Elsevier Book entitled "Practical Micromechanics
  of Composite Materials" by Prof Aboudi, Arnold and Bednarcyk, to be published in

  2021. Developed in MATLAB R2018a.'
