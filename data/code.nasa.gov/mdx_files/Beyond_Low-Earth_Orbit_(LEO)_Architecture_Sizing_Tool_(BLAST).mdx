description: A user-friendly, configurable spacecraft sizing tool, BLAST provides
  a shareable, re-creatable and rigorous end-to-end multi-element architecture framework
  that has been used to generate mass data for in-space, beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO)
  transportation vehicles and architectures. Offering a novel approach to modeling,
  BLAST couples extensive MER research with the ability to assess mission changes
  instantaneously by analyzing sensitivity sweeps of several parameters at once.
