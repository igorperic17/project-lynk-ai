description: VirtualADAPT is a high-fidelity, Matlab Simulink-based simulation testbed
  that emulates the Advanced Diagnostic and Prognostic Testbed (ADAPT) electrical
  power system hardware for running offline health management experiments. This simulation
  testbed models all components of the ADAPT hardware within the power storage and
  power distribution subsystems. The physical components of the testbed, i.e., the
  batteries, relays, and the loads, are replaced by simulation modules that generate
  the same dynamic behaviors as the hardware test bed.
