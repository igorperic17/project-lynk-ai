description: This tool includes three general types of scripts. The first one extracts
  average NDVI values from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 image collections for specified
  reference dates (typically a period of 10-15 years). Anomalies in NDVI values are
  then derived from Landsat 5 & 8 reference image collections from later dates (typically
  the year after the reference period to present). Various graphs and charts are produced
  showing positive and negative NDVI changes for specified points. The results are
  also visualized on the map as either areas of NDVI gain (displayed in green) or
  NDVI loss (displayed in red). The second types of scripts included scripts that
  perform unsupervised classifications to determine marsh extent for a variety of
  years and were made by applying a mask over the specified study area that incorporates
  elevation data to exclude regions over a specified height above average sea-level.
  These scripts require the user to choose classified pixel clusters that represent
  marsh land cover by using the Google Earth Inspector tab and then entering those
  values into the script to generate the marsh extent maps. Results of these scripts
  include classification maps for various years (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, etc.). The
  user can then decide to export those results into either their Assets or their Drive,
  or both. A third type of script is used for statistics regarding the classified
  maps generated in the classification scripts. These statistics include total pixel
  number and total marsh area calculated into square meters after the marsh extent
  pixels are clipped to our study area (the State of Maryland).
