description: The Generic Transport model is a simplified flight simulation model of
  a typical transport aircraft using the Langley Standard Simulation in C++ (LaSRS++)
  framework.  It was designed to provide similar, but not exact, representation of
  aircraft performance.  The emphasis was on flexibility and simplicity.  Originally
  the intent was to use the model for testing simulation hardware and for demonstrations.  No
  proprietary data is used in the model.  Most of the coefficients are linearized,
  and based on the set of parameters provided in Roskam, Airplane Flight Dynamics
  (Reference 1) when available.  The intent was that any other transport aircraft
  could be modeled at the same level by providing the equivalent set of data.  (Appendix
  C describes levels of simulation modeling.)  This makes it possible to model different
  aircraft by reading in the values from a file.
