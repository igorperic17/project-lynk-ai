description: Worldview is a software tool designed for interactively browsing and
  downloading imagery from NASA's Earth observing satellites.  Building upon a set
  of open source mapping and user interface libraries, it provides an environment
  to visually discover interesting phenomena as observed by NASA satellites, then
  download the data for further analysis.  It was originally designed to address the
  needs of the near real time applications community to provide relevant information
  for time-critical scenarios such as wildfire and flood management.  As such, satellite
  imagery is available to be viewed in Worldview within four hours of observation,
  the imagery can be viewed in its highest, or native, resolution, and the imagery
  can be panned and zoomed rapidly through space and time to find the most relevant/cloud-free/etc
  information available.
