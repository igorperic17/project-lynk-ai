description: The ROBUS-2 Protocol Processor (RPP) is a custom-designed hardware component
  implementing the functionality of the ROBUS-2 fault-tolerant communication system.
  The Reliable Optical Bus (ROBUS) is the core communication system of the Scalable
  Processor-Independent Design for Enhanced Reliability (SPIDER), a general-purpose
  fault-tolerant integrated modular architecture currently under development at NASA
  Langley Research Center. ROBUS is a time-division multiple access (TDMA) broadcast
  communication system with medium access control by means of time-indexed communication
  schedule. ROBUS-2 is a developmental version of the ROBUS providing guaranteed fault-tolerant
  services to the attached processing elements (PEs), in the presence of a bounded
  number of faults.
