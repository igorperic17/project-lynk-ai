description: The DPLR software package is a suite of CFD tools for the computation
  of supersonic and hypersonic flows in chemical and thermal nonequilibrium. Included
  in the package are 2D/axisymmetric and 3D structured grid finite volume Navier-Stokes
  codes, a pre-processor, and a post-processor. The code supports implicit boundary
  conditions, generalized multi-block topologies, grid alignment to flow features,
  and generalized chemical kinetics and thermodynamic property databases.
