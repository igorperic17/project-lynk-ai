description: The Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) is a state-of-the-art, modular 3D
  chemistry and transport model (CTM) that can be used for assessment of the impact
  of various natural and anthropogenic perturbations on atmospheric composition and
  chemistry, including, but not exclusively, the effect of aircraft.
