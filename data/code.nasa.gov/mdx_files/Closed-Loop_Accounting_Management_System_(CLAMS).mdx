description: The Closed-Loop Accounting Management System (CLAMS) is a Web-based application
  used to disseminate critical processing information to the workforce and provide
  feedback to management that the information was received. The tool allows management
  at any level to accurately track any critical information, and it also serves as
  a historical database of what information was sent out, to whom, and when it was
  received. CLAMS has potential application as shareware to companies using Cold Fusion
  Server software.
