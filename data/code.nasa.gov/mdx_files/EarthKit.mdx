description: EarthKit provides a framework for collaboration among researchers in
  Earth science. It provides a set of software tools for sharing any user's research
  environment via the web and managing workflows that run in the cloud. By leveraging
  cloud computing services in this novel way, EarthKit can instantly replicate a reesarch
  computing environment (software, data, operating system environment and hardware).
