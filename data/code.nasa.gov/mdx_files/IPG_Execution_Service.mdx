description: The Execution Service allows users to submit, monitor, and cancel complex
  jobs. Each job consists of a set of tasks that perform actions such as executing
  applications and managing data. Each task is executed based on a starting condition
  that is an expression on the states of other tasks. This formulation allows tasks
  to be executed in parallel and also allows a user to specify tasks to execute when
  other tasks succeed, fail or are cancelled.
