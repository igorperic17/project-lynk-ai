description: The INS3D code solves the incompressible Naiver-Stokes equations in three-dimensional
  generalized coordinates for both steady-state and time varying flow.  The equations
  are formulated using the method of artificial compressibility. The convective terms
  are differenced using an upwind biased flux-difference splitting.  The equations
  are solved using an implicit line-relaxation scheme.  The code is written for single
  or multiple-zone calculations.  It can utilize either pointwise continuous zonal
  interfaces, or overset zonal interfaces if a PEGASUS interpolation database is supplied.  The
  INS3D code is written in Fortran77 and C.  The code only runs in a serial execution
  mode.  This code was developed in the 1990s and is no longer under development at
  NASA.
