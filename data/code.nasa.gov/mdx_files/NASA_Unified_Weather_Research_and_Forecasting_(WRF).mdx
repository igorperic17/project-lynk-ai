description: 'At NASA, WRF is being used to study: the precipitation processes associated
  with several high-impact weather events; aerosol impact on the area climate and
  water cycles over monsoon regions; the influence of land surface heterogeneity and
  soil moisture gradients on land-atmosphere interactions; explicit simulations of
  hurricanes; and interactive chemistry-aerosol processes.'
