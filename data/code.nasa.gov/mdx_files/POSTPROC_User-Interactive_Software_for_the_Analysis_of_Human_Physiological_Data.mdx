description: POSTPROC offers researchers and clinicians user-friendly software for
  processing and analyzing human physiological data. Measurements include electrocardiography,
  electromyography, respiration, beat-to-beat blood pressure, skin temperature, blood
  volume pulse, skin conductance levels, and cardiovascular dynamics derived from
  impedance. The customized application runs under DADiSP/2002, a commercially available
  engineering spreadsheet from DSP Development Corporation.
