description: The Morpheus flight software is a complete set of vehicle software including
  propulsion; guidance, navigation, and control; space-like command and telemetry
  communication, and all support systems necessary to fly an autonomous closed-loop
  vehicle mission.  Novel approaches to this software included for the first time
  at JSC, embracing the Core Flight Software (CFS) developed by Goddard Space Flight
  Center; componentizing guidance, navigation and control (GNC) into a plug-and-play
  architecture, utilizing an open-source development environment housing the software
  triad needed for integration - flight, ground, and simulation;  and embedding the
  flight software within a vehicle simulation.
