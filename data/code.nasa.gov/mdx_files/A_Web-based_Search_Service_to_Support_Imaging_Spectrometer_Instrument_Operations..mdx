description: 'Just as web search involves more than matching phrases, spectral search
  is more challenging than simply matching the shape of the spectrum.  The background
  substrate and illumination changes can cause the same signature to appear very different
  across scenes.  Here, the search service uses an adaptive matched-filter approach
  that compensates for the context and background characteristics of each scene.  '
