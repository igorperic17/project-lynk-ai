description: The Delta-V Along Line of Sight (DVALOS) Software provides a capability
  to calculate an expected radial delta-V as seen from a supporting Deep Space Network
  (DSN) tracking station based on a planned maneuver for a DSN tracked spacecraft.  DVALOS
  may then be used post maneuver to compare observed versus expected delta-V in order
  to discern maneuver burn performance.
