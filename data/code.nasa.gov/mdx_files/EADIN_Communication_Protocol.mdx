description: The product of this work is a communication protocol which allows microcontrollers
  to talk with eachother in a structured fashion. As such, it is embodied in C++ code
  that runs on the microcontroller. The software is not mission certified and is being
  used for demonstration and testing purposes only. The current goal of this project
  is to realease the software open source to enable community participation. We have
  external companies requesting that we release this software.
