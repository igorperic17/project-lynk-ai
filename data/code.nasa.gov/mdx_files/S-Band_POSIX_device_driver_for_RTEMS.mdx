description: Defines a device driver that runs using the POSIX real-time operating
  system package to provide a FPGA interface to the S-Band hardware for the CoNNeCT
  experiment. Instead of interacting with hardware devices directly using direct-memory
  mapped access at the application level, this driver provides an API offering easy
  to use standard POSIX function calls. This simplifies application programming as
  well as offering an additional level of protection to the hardware and portability.
