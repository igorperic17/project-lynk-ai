description: 'The fundamental problem of cloud parameterization is to characterize
  the distributions of cloud variables at sub-grid scales and to relate the sub-grid
  variations to the resolved flow. This software solves the problem by estimating
  the probability density function of cloud water content at the sub-grid scale using
  CloudSat measurements. This tool uses a statistical method called Maximum Likelihood
  Estimation to estimate the probability density function of the cloud water content. '
