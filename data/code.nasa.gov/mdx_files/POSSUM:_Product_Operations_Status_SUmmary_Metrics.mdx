description: 'POSSUM provides a graphical presentation tracking and accountability
  of the existence and version of expected Reduced Data Records (RDRs) for a given
  Experiment Data Record (EDR) for the Phoenix lander mission. By using POSSUM, operations
  personnel can easily determine if any RDRs are missing for a given EDR during and
  after the OPGS processing pipeline. POSSUM offers a variety of sorting options,
  such as product file creation time and instrument. '
