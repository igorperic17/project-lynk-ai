description: Ballast is a tool for balancing user load across Secure Shell Handler
  (SSH) servers. The system includes a load-balancing client, a lightweight data server,
  scripts for collecting system load, and scripts for analyzing user behavior. Because
  Ballast is invoked as part of the SSH login process, it has access to user names.
  This capability, which is not available in traditional approaches, enables Ballast
  to perform user-specific load balancing. In addition, Ballast is easy to install,
  induces near-zero overhead, and has fault-tolerant features in its architectures
  that will eliminate single points of failure.
