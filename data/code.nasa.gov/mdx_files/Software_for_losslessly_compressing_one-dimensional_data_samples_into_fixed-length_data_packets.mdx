description: The software could be used for compression of one-dimensional data sources
  that must be transmitted in fixed-length packets under significant complexity constraints,
  as might sometimes arise onboard spacecraft. The software losslessly compresses
  data samples from a one-dimensional source into fixed-length data packets. The software's
  intended application is for seismic and ultrasound data to be transmitted over a
  network that is subject to packet losses.
