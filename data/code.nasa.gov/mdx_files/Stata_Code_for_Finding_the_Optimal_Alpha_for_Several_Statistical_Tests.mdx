description: 'Two main types of errors occur in statistical hypothesis testing: type
  I errors reject a default hypothesis when it is actually correct, and type II errors
  fail to reject the default hypothesis when it is incorrect. The probability of type
  I errors is conventionally denoted as alpha, while the probability of type II errors
  is conventionally denoted as beta. The NASA code developed in this effort calculates
  the optimal alpha in Stata statistical software for several versions of statistical
  hypothesis tests.'
