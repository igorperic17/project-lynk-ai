description: 'The GNEIMO methods and algorithms build up on the Spatial Operator Algebra
  (SOA) multibody dynamics framework. The specific problems addressed in this work
  are velocity intialization techniques that are consistent with the CICMD equipartition
  priniciple, techniques for nulling momentum drift, analysis and solutions for the
  flying ice-cube effect, and performance of integration schemes. '
