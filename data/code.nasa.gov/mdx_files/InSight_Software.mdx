description: "The InSight application is designed to execute on Windows XP or later\
  \ platforms. Its basic premise is to provide a common command and data display graphical\
  \ user interface (GUI) for data streams originating from an extensible set of data\
  \ sources. A data source may be either a physical interface type (i.e., serial or\
  \ GPIB buses) or a virtual interface represented by an application programming interface\
  \ (API) provided by a vendor that abstracts the underlying physical interface (i.e.,\
  \ Trick simulations using the Trick API or NIDAQmx).\r\nMultiple devices/instruments\
  \ under test (DUT) may be connected to a single data source depending upon what\
  \ the underlying operating system interface (OSI) media layers allow. Each data\
  \ source type is abstracted to the GUI through a dynamic link library (DLL) that\
  \ provides a common programming interface. Multiple data sources of each type are\
  \ allowed. By authoring a new DLL that adheres to the InSight API, new data source\
  \ types can be added."
