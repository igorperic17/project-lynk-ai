description: IND is applicable to most data sets consisting of independent instances,
  each described by a fixed length vector of attribute values. An attribute value
  may be a number, one of a set of attribute specific symbols, or omitted. One of
  the attributes is delegated the 'target' and IND grows trees to predict the target.
  Prediction can then be done on new data or the decision tree printed out for inspection.
