description: "FATMaCC (Five-Axis, Three-Magnetic-Bearing Control Code), is a versatile\
  \ control code that possesses many desirable features that were not available in\
  \ previous in-house controllers.  The ultimate goal in designing this code was to\
  \ achieve full rotor levitation and control at a loop time of 50 s.  Using a 1-GHz\
  \ processor the code will control a five-axis system in either a decentralized or\
  \ a more elegant centralized (model control) mode at loop time of 56  s.  In addition,\
  \ it will levitate and control (with only minor modification to the input-output\
  \ wiring) a two-axis and / or a four-axis system.  Stable rotor levitation and control\
  \ of any of the system mentioned above are accomplished through appropriate key\
  \ presses to modify parameters, such as stiffness, damping, and bias.  A signal\
  \ generation block provides 11 excitation signals.  An excitation signal is then\
  \ superimposed on the radial bearing x- and y- control signals, thus producing a\
  \ resultant force vector.  By modulating the signals on the bearing x0 and y- axes\
  \ with a cosine and sine function, respectively, a radial excitation force vector\
  \ is made to rotate 360 about the bearing geometric center.  The rotation of the\
  \ force vector is achieved manually by using key press or automatically by engaging\
  \ the \" one-per-revolution\" feature.  Rotor rigid body modes can be excited by\
  \ using the excitation module.  Depending on the polarities of the excitation signal\
  \ in each radial bearing, the bounce or tilt mode will be excited.\r\n\r\nmagnetic\
  \ bearings are an enabling technology for rotating devices with extremely high rotational\
  \ speeds, such as flywheel energy storage systems being proposed for the International\
  \ Space Station.  In addition these bearings have great potential for conventional\
  \ gas turbine engines especially because the control algorithms can compensate for\
  \ an event such as loss of a blade that causes rotor imbalance."
