description: JavaGenes-Scheduler is a general purpose evolutionary system designed
  to compare techniques for scheduling observations. It was originally developed for
  scheduling observations made by Earth-observing satellites. JavaGenes-Scheduler
  uses a simple, earliest-first scheduler to insert observations into the timeline
  in permutation order.
