description: Version 5 of the Space Shuttle Ascent/Entry Trainer (AET) is a simulation
  software package that models NASA's Space Shuttle in both ascent and entry scenarios
  in order to train astronauts. Functionally, the AET handles operator inputs to the
  hand controllers and to virtual switches on the computer monitor, and it provides
  feedback to the operator via the computer monitor in the form of simulated out-the-window
  graphics and emulated display and control panels.
