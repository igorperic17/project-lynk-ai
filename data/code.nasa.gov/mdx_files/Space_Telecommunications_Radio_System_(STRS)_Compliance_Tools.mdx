description: These tools are used to help verify software compliance to the NASA-developed
  Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) architecture. The goal of STRS is to
  support waveform application portability, upgradability, and reduce the cost and
  risk of using Software Defined Radios for NASA. ComplianceTool.sh is a Bourne shell
  script that tests an STRS application for the appropriate method signatures. The
  output is a web page containing the results.  ComplianceToolOE.sh is a Bourne shell
  script that tests the STRS infrastructure for the required named constants, typedefs,
  and structs. The output is a web page containing the results. The command and compliance
  application, WFCCN, is ported, compiled, and linked with an STRS infrastructure
  to verify static compliance such that all required STRS infrastructure-provided
  methods are implemented as well as the named constants, typedefs, and structs. WFCCN
  may also be executed for dynamic compliance testing. The tools are described in
  "STRS Compliance Testing", NASA/TM 2011-217266.
