description: RAPID is a software reference implementation framework for remote operations.
  The technology promotes interoperability between robot software modules and includes
  a standard programming interface and data distribution middleware. RAPID facilitates
  integration of experimental robot software modules created by a distributed development
  team; improves the compatibility and reusability of robotic functions; and offers
  speed prototype robot development in a wide range of configurations and environments.
