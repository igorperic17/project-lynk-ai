description: 'The EEPROM File System (EEFS) is a simple, reliable file system for
  embedded systems. The primary purpose of the EEFS is to provide a file system abstraction
  for EEPROM or PROM memories that is simple, efficient, and can be proven to be reliable.  The
  EEFS can be used on embedded systems where a file system is needed to access data
  from EEPROM, PROM, or RAM memory, but otherwise might not have the resources to
  deploy a full file system such as the MSDOS file system. The EEPROM file system
  can also be used in systems where the ability to dump, patch, and diagnose files
  is required. '
