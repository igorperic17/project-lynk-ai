description: 'The Periodic Table of Life (PeTaL, pronounced petal) is intended to
  be a design tool to enable a deeper understanding of natural systems and to enable
  the creation or improvement of nature-inspired systems. The tool includes an unstructured
  database, data analytics tools and a web-based user interface. Three levels of information
  are expected to be captured: morphology that would aid designers by providing context-specific
  physical design rules, function-morphology relationships to provide nature-inspired
  solution strategies, and system-level relationships that involve the interaction
  of several biological models including flow of resources and energy. In its current
  form, PeTaL is structured as a large NoSQL database that will be accessible to researchers
  and citizen scientists. It includes entomological and paleontological data from
  the Cleveland Museum of Natural History (CMNH) in Cleveland, OH, the Cincinnati
  Museum Center in Cincinnati, OH and the Smithsonian. PeTaL can display relationships
  between biological models, geography, and environment through maps and plots. These
  may be used to glean patterns or design rules. Data can also be downloaded for further
  analysis. A more systematic design process is under development that will allow
  multiple models to be used for the various stages of design.'
