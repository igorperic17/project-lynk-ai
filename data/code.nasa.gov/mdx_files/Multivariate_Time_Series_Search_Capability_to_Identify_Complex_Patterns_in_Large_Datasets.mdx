description: 'This software allows the user to specify a time series over multiple
  variables to search within massive datasets. The tool will return a listing of events
  (a time series) from the database that spans multiple variables and is within a
  threshold distance from the query. Experiments on numerous real aviation datasets
  have demonstrated the algorithm''s capability to uncover potential aircraft safety
  events (as validated by multiple aviation safety experts and airlines). '
