description: The Scheduler application (SCH) is a core Flight System (cFS) application
  that is a plug in to the Core Flight Executive (cFE) component of the cFS. The Scheduler
  application uses a one-second major timeframe, which is divided into a designer-determined
  collection of equally divided minor timeframes. The technology is configurable and
  table-driven to provide greater flexibility.
