description: The NASA Technology Transfer System (NTTS) Search and Reporting application
  programming interface (API) uses various logical operators to query well-structured
  Extensible Markup Language (XML) data. The algorithm is capable of providing search
  results maintaining one-to-many relationships, and it will perform set operations
  that include Union, Intersection, and Difference. Output can be retrieved in XML
  or comma-separated value (CSV) format. The interface will provide content search
  criteria within a context or scope, dynamically interpret operations based on data
  type, and perform set operations in combination with logical operations.
