description: The RNM simulation model calculates community noise, computing time histories
  of noise for arbitrary vehicle flight operations. The technology accommodates multiple
  noise sources (e.g., rotors and engines), each represented by a sphere of spectral
  data at a reference distance. Propagation to the ground accounts for spherical spreading,
  atmospheric absorption, ground impedance effects, and limited weather effects.
