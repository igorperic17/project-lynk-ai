description: Savors is a tool for security event monitoring, analysis, and response.
  The technology scales to real-world environments and uses high-end computing resources
  on-demand to compile behavior profiles that point to anomalous behavior. Auralization
  allows both monitoring and analysis to be performed in parallel and draws attention
  to critical events in one tool when utilizing another. Remote data access and response
  capabilities across distributed resources are enabled using grid computing that
  provides a secure, single sign-on environment.
