description: 'Due to mechanical backlash, calibration errors, and other sources, errors
  in camera pointing knowledge create geometric seams in image mosaics, where the
  individual images do not line up properly. For rover missions, motion of the rover
  in between frames can create additional seams. This software corrects these geometric
  seams as much as possible (some parallax seams are uncorrectable). This software
  provides one with the ability to understand in-situ mission image metadata that
  allows the pointing overlap to be determined in advance and the corrections automatically
  applied. '
