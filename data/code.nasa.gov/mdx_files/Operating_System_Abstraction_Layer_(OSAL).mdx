description: 'The OSAL library isolates embedded application software from a Real-Time
  Operating System (RTOS). The technology provides a well-defined, generic interface
  to RTOS services; a generic interface to hardware services; and an implementation
  for several current RTO systems. By using the library, an embedded application can
  remain portable among multiple operating systems on multiple platforms. Please visit
