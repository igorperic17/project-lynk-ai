description: STASS simulates air traffic in the terminal area and ground traffic on
  the terminal surface. The technology uses time-based queues at various locations
  along an aircraft's trajectory to model traffic. For arrivals, queue locations include
  the freeze horizon, metering fixes, and runways. For departures, queues are positioned
  at airport gates, runways, and metering fixes. Flight time uncertainty is modeled
  using probability distributions around queue arrival times.
