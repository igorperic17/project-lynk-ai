description: GeoCam is a geospatial system for disaster response that consists of
  (1) low-cost consumer hardware (i.e., a digital camera or cell phone, position/orientation
  sensors, and an optional embedded controller) and (2) a Web-based workflow that
  enables images and other geo-referenced data to be shared and viewed in a variety
  of ways. GeoCam includes software that computes image location and provides for
  geo-rectification, KML-formatted geospatial data generation, image management, and
  geo-referenced data sharing.
