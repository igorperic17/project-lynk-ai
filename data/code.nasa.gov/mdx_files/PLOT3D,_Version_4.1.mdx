description: 'PLOT3D is a computer graphics program designed to visualize the grid
  and solutions of structured computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. Version
  4.1 uses the OpenGL/GLUT graphics library. Several new features have been added
  to the code. These include: automatic computation of grid coordinate minimum/maximum;
  an orphan point plotting function; the ability to read double-precision unformatted
  data; negative grid index processing; random specification of colors for different
  walls; and simultaneous specification of walls and subsets for all zones.'
