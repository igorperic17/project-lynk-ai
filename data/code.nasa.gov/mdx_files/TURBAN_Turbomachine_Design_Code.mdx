description: TURBAN analysis is performed at the arithmetic mean diameter. The stage
  velocity diagrams are either all similar (therefore have the same work factor) or
  are determined from an input stage work split. All stages have the same stator exit
  angle. Stage-by-stage tailoring of the velocity diagrams is not allowed.
