description: 'This software is a prototype of a comprehensive hurricane information
  system of high-resolution satellite, airborne and in-situ observationsand model
  outputs pertaining to: i) the thermodynamic and microphysical structure ofthe storms;
  ii) the air-sea interaction processes; iii) the larger-scale environmentas depicted
  by the SST, ocean heat content and the aerosol loading of the environment. Our goal
  was to create a one-stop place that will provide to the researchers an extensive
  set of observed hurricane parameters (both graphics and data) together with large-scale
  and convection-resolving model output, all organized in an easy way to determine
  when coincident observations from multiple instruments are available. '
