description: TestEVAL was generated to provide a tool for processing and plotting
  mechanical test data.  This tool is used for both handling pre-test planning and
  post test processing.  The tool provides plotting capability for different data
  formats, including Nastran xyplot punch files, Excel files, CSV files, Matlab files,
  and network communication via pipes.  The data can plotted in linear, log or semi-log
  scales.  Data can be modified and processed against other data sets to assist in
  understanding the test responses or predictions.
