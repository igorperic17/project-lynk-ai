description: The Sun Format Database (SunAcc) was developed to fulfill a need for
  local native storage of Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) test data. While the file
  format itself is native to the Sun UNIX platform, the read/write library was developed
  to be a cross-platform tool and is compatible with a variety of UNIX and Windows
  platforms.
