description: 'A newly developed 3-D software visualization tool for supporting spacecraft
  GN&C simulations relevant to small body exploration and sampling. The software is
  developed in Matlab and provides users with the ability to visualize the behavior
  of their simulations, regardless of whichprogramming language (or machine), is used
  to generate simulation results. The only requirement is that multibody simulation
  data is generated and placed in the proper format before applying G-View. '
