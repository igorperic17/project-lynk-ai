description: JeNo is a Fortran 90 computer code that evaluates the far-field turbulence-generated
  noise in non-axisymmetric jets. The propagation Green's function is calculated along
  a user-specified azimuthal angle (line of sight), but source volume integration
  is carried out in 3D. The user must provide a structured computational grid in a
  polar coordinate system and also input a mean flow solution from a Reynolds-Averaged
  Navier Stokes (RANS).
