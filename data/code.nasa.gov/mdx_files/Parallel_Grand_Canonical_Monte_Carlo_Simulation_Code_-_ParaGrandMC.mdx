description: "The Parallel Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation code (ParaGrandMC)\
  \ is a highly parallelized code in FORTRAN for simulating the thermodynamic evolution\
  \ of metal alloy systems at atomic level, and predicting their thermodynamic state,\
  \ phase diagram, chemical composition and mechanical properties. The approach taken\
  \ is based on evolving an initially given atomic system (defined through a list\
  \ of atomic coordinates of all participating atoms) using Monte Carlo algorithm.\
  \ The algorithm is based on repeated random sampling of the configuration space\
  \ of the system using the classical Boltzmann probability distribution. In the process,\
  \ internal variables of the system, such as system energy, internal pressure, system\
  \ size (strain), and others, are reported periodically. Atomic configurations, in\
  \ terms of coordinates of all atoms, are stored periodically for a post-processing\
  \ analysis, such as phase identification, lattice parameter estimates, free energy\
  \ integration, etc. The algorithm uses MPI (message passing interface) to work on\
  \ multi-core CPU platforms allowing simulations of multimilion atom systems. \r\n\
  \r\nThe code is designed to help exploring the phase diagram of multi-component\
  \ alloy systems, predict solid-state phase transformations such as austenite-martensite\
  \ transformations, precipitate formation, recrystallization, capillary effects at\
  \ interfaces, surface absorption, etc., which can aid the design of novel metallic\
  \ alloys. While the software is mainly tailored for modeling metal alloys, it can\
  \ also be used for any other types of solid-state systems, and to some degree for\
  \ liquid or gaseous systems, including multiphase systems forming solid-liquid-gas\
  \ interfaces. "
