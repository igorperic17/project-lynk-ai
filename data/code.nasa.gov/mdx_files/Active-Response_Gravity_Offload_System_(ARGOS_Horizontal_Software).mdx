description: ARGOS provides a simulated environment to test robotic systems and humans
  in reduced gravity, including microgravity and lunar and Martian environments. Generation
  1 of the technology repurposed a commercial off-the-shelf load management system
  as a proof of concept. Generation 2 utilizes a fully custom design with expanded
  system capabilities for speed and load capacity.
