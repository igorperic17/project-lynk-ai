description: The Acoustic Propagation and Emulation Toolset (APET) is a framework
  code uniting several acoustic methodologies for the propagation and measurement
  of source noise audibility at farfield observers, accounting for the effects of
  the atmosphere, weather, terrain, and spherical spreading. Currently, APET consists
  of a modified version of the Rotorcraft Noise Model (RNM, Version 7) coupled with
  the newly developed Spectral Attenuation Method (SAM) that contains the Ray Tracing
  Program (RTP) and two versions of a Greens Function Parabolic Equation (GFPE) code.
  A third component of APET is an audibility prediction scheme based on the work of
  Abrahamson, initially called ICHIN (I Can Hear It Now) and further developed by
  Wyle Labs as AUDIB.
