description: 'SCRUB is a code review tool that supports both large team-based software
  development efforts (e.g., for mission software) and individual programming tasks.
  The tool was developed at JPL to support a new streamlined code review process that
  combines human generated review reports with program-generated analyses reports
  from a customizable range of state-of-the-art source code analyzers. All reports
  are accessed through a single uniform interface that facilitates browsing code and
  reports. '
