description: 'This software can be used by light project funded by NASA. This interface
  can also be used by other airborne scienceinstruments.Some of the main features
  of the interface include drawing flight lines on the map, nudging them, adding them
  to the current flight plan, and reordering them. The user can also search and select
  takeoff, landing, and intermediate airports. As the flight plan is constructed,
  all of its components are constantly being saved to the database and the estimated
  flight times are updated. '
