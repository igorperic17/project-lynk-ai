description: Growler is a C++-based distributed object and event architecture. It
  is written in C++, and supports serialization of C++ objects as part of its Remote
  Method Invocation, Event Channels, and in its Interface Definition Language. Its
  primary application has been in support of interactive, distributed visualization,
  computational steering, and concurrent visualization, but it is a general purpose
  system for distributed programming.
