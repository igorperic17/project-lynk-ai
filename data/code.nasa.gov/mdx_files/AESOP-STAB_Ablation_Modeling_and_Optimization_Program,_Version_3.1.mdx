description: To help maximize payload capability, AESOP-STAB determines the minimum
  weight of an n-layer thermal protection system (TPS) material subject to temperature
  constraints. Originally developed in the 1970s, code modifications include enhanced
  environment input options, solution routines, and material response capabilities.
  To use the program, the user must define the thermal model, select the desired optimization
  procedure(s), define all thermo-physical properties for each material, and provide
  the desired boundary conditions (i.e., heating rates and back wall conditions).
  AESOP-STAB was designed to make the preparation of input data as simple as possible.
