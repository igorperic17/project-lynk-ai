description: This software enables easy comparison of ground- and space-based radar
  observations. The software was initially designed to compare ground radar reflectivity
  from operational, ground-based, S- and C-band meteorological radars with comparable
  measurements from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite's Precipitation
  Radar instrument. The software is also applicable to other ground-based and space-based
  radars. The software allows both ground and space based radar data to be compared
  for validation purposes.
