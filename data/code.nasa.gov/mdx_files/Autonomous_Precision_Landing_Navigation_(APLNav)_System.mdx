description: The APLNav system provides a simple, cost-effective, reliable, and proven
  optical terrain navigation tool for planetary landing applications. Passive optical
  digital cameras are used to create surface images that are rendered against a digital
  elevation model. The system is derived from the digital scene-mapping and area correlation
  navigation method that has been employed by cruise missiles for decades.
