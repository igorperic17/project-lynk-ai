description: 'The NASA Auralization Framework (NAF) is an open architecture for auralization
  components.  It is structured as a set of common building blocks in the form of
  dynamically linked libraries, and will serve as the basis for future auralization
  capabilities.  There are several libraries provided as part of the Framework: a
  Core Library, a Pathfinder library, a Scene Generator library, a Synthesis library,
  a Signal Processing library, and a Scheduler library.  Each library contains a usable
  but very simple set of capabilities.  An example application and several test cases
  provided with the Framework demonstrate how to use the libraries together to perform
  auralization tasks.  It is expected that users will build their own customizations
  on the provided libraries, making use of the underlying framework, to create plugins
  for NAF that perform more complex operations.'
