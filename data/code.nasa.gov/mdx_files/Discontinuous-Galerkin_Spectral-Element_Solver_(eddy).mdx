description: Eddy is a fundamental research code for advancing spectral methods for
  complex geometry.   This software is intended to enable researchers to collaborate
  through a common framework which enables three-dimensional simulations on practical
  problems.    Areas of interest include advanced numerical algorithms, computational
  optimization, scale-resolving turbulence models, and high-order mesh generation.
