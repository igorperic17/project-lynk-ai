description: To enable these enhancements at runtime in MD, this library uses the
  so-called load-time weaving strategy. AspectJ is an aspect-oriented extension to
  Java. Because AspectJ operates at the level of bytecode, it is also applicable to
  other languages like Scala that compile to the JVM.
