description: The ATMS software calculates instrument beam pointing and polarization
  state. Input is taken in the native MI Technologies MI-3000 antenna measurements
  system database format and should include sets of azimuth/elevation RF radiation
  pattern cuts (at multiple phi rotations) or discrete frequencies.
