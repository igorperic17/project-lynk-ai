description: IMS software utilizes techniques from the fields of model-based reasoning,
  machine learning, and data mining to build system monitoring knowledge bases from
  archived or simulated sensor data. The technology automatically analyzes the nominal
  system data to form general classes of expected system sensor values; these classes
  are used to build a monitoring knowledge base. When monitoring a system, IMS simply
  checks to see how well the incoming sensor data fit into the classes derived from
  the training data.
