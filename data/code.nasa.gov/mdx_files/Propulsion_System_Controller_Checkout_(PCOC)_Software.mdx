description: The Propulsion System Controller Checkout (PCOC) Computer served as the
  electrical ground support equipment for FASTRAC engine avionics. The PCOC software
  that executed on the computer provided a window into engine operation, as well as
  main propulsion system operation and thrust vector control system operation. The
  software displayed a graphical representation of the FASTRAC engine and associated
  MPS, offering visual indications of tank levels, valve positions, propellant locations,
  and engine ignition.
