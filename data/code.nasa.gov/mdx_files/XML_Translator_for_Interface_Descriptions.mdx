description: This software addresses the inconsistency in the interface implementation
  between FPGAs and software commonly results in difficult to test, identify, and
  fix failures in NASA Space flight systems. The tool forces functionally identical
  interface implementations on both sides of the interface. The XML Parser is a program
  that produces header files in C, Verilog, and VHDL that describe an FPGA interface.
  These header files are created from an XML file describing the interface, and they
  define constants that allow a programmer to use each register and to access each
  individual field in the register. The XML Parser is run as part of the make process,
  which ensures that whenever an interface is changed, all of the code that uses the
  header files describing it is recompiled.
