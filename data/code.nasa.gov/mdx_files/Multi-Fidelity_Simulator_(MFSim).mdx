description: Multi-Fidelity Simulator, MFSim is a pluggable framework for creating
  an air traffic flow simulator at multiple levels of fidelity. The framework is designed
  to allow low-fidelity simulations of the entire US Airspace to be completed very
  quickly (on the order of seconds). The framework allows higher-fidelity plugins
  to be added to allow higher-fidelity simulations to occur in certain regions of
  the airspace concurrently with the low-fidelity simulation of the full airspace.
