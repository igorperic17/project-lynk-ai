description: A cost-effective e-Business solution, the Task Order Management System
  (TOMS) allows for the paperless processing and tracking of virtually any type of
  government task order contract. The tool provides a standardized user interface
  into a centralized task order database. TOMS will track a task order from its initiation,
  through the approval cycle, and out to the vendor and back. The approval cycle function
  works through email notifications and can be tailored easily to meet the needs of
  any organization. Completely Web-based, TOMS allows for real-time access and will
  provide an up-to-the-minute status of each task order.
