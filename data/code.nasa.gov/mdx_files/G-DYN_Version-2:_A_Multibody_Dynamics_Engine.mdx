description: 'This software is used in simulating touch and go maneuvers of robotic
  sampling system from a comet or asteroid. The algorithm is based on a primal-dual
  formulation of the dynamics that captures the interaction forces (dual formulation
  variables) between bodies, which is particularly useful for control and estimation
  analysis and synthesis. Furthermore, the dynamics model for each body can easily
  be replaced by a new model without re-deriving the overall equations of motion,
  and the assembly of the equations of motion is done automatically. '
