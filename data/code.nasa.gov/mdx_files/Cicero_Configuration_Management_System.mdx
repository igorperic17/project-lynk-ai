description: Cicero is a generic, customizable, Web-based database application designed
  to facilitate the document change process. In addition to providing a Web site from
  which approved personnel may download current versions of base-lined documentation
  for their projects, Cicero supports the creation and management of configuration
  change requests (CCRs). Through Cicero, configured documents may be modified in
  a controlled fashion.
