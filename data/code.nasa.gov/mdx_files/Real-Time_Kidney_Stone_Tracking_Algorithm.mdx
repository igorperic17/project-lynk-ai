description: A software component of the Rolling Stones prototype, this algorithm
  uses focused ultrasound to clear stones from a kidney. The tool processes a series
  of B-mode images to track a region of interest, offers visual feedback of position
  location to the user, and targets a stone for automated adaptive pushing. The algorithm
  uses a colored display scheme to report a confidence estimation of stone location.
