description: The Traffic Situation Display (TSD) is an integrated display of air traffic,
  weather, terrain, and special use airspace.  TSD was designed to serve as a primary
  graphical interface for ground operators/dispatchers supporting research simulation
  of single pilot and/or reduced crew operations. One key feature is the seamless
  transitional flow between the ego-referenced and position-referenced frames.
