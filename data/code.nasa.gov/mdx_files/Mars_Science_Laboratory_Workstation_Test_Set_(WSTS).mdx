description: The WSTS is currently being used in the mainline flight software development
  process for the MSL project. The WSTS (Workstation Test Set) is used by the MSL
  flight software team for development. It provides PCI card level simulation for
  avionics hardware, allowing testing for all but the lowest layers of the software.
  It uses POSIX shared memory and synchronization in a Linux environment to provide
  high-resolution simulation time-slicing. The software uses Linux shared memory to
  emulate PCI hardware, and uses POSIX synchronization facilities to synchronize the
  interaction between simulation and the flight software.
