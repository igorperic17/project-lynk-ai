description: A calculational procedure has been designed and implemented in software
  that enables the specification and design of a space-based optical communications
  system.  The resulting optical link budget essentially accounts for the communication
  power flow through the entire optical communications channel from the transmitter
  to the receiver and yields design specifications for the optical system necessary
  to assure reliable data transmission with desired operational metrics such as data
  rate, link margin, etc.  The link budget takes into account all the sources of deleterious
  noise that enters into the communications process such as electronically generated
  noise in the optical detector and stray optical irradiance from external sources.  The
  link budget has the capability of being interfaced with the orbital element calculations
  of the Satellite Tool Kit (STK) to allow the dynamic description and evolution of
  optical link operation from any space-borne satellite within the solar system to
  and from the earth.
