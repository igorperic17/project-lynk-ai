description: 'NASA atmospheric and Earth science missions generate vast amounts of
  data every day. Clustering algorithms are used in various applications including
  pattern recognition, classification, data compression, regression, and related optimization
  problems. The design implements a computational solution for an autonomous data-reduction/clustering
  process to produce a representative distribution and joint relationships of the
  data without assuming a specific type of distribution and relationship nor resorting
  to domain-specific knowledge about the data. '
