description: 'Mars missions will generate a large amount of data in various forms,
  such as daily plans, images, and other science information returned. There is often
  times a semantic linking between pieces of data that cannot be captured automatically,
  i.e. images containing rocks. This software provides a method for creating arbitrary
  tags for mission data; two items with the same tag are related to each other, and
  can be searched (or recalled) through the tag. The tags are shared by all users,
  meaning that one user may tag data for the benefit, or to gain the attention, of
  another user. '
