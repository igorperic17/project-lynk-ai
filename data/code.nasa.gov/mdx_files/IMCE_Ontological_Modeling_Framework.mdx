description: 'JPL''s Integrated Model-Centric Engineering (IMCE) initiative developed
  ontologies for Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to support JPL''s MBSE practices
  and methodologies. The IMCE ontologies have been carefully engineered to provide
  support for scalable query and reasoning according to the semantics of the Ontology
  Web Language (OWL) standard in such a way that these ontologies can be mapped as
  extensions of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) & Systems Modeling Language (SysML)
  standards. '
