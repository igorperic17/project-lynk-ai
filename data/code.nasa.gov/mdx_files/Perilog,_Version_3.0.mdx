description: Perilog software capabilities include keyword-in-context search, flexible
  phrase search, search by example, phrase generation, and phrase extraction. The
  technology's keyword-in-context search feature retrieves documents that contain
  one or more user-specified keywords in context, ranks documents on their relevance
  to the keywords in context, and displays the documents with the query words highlighted
  and, optionally, with strongly associated words also highlighted.
