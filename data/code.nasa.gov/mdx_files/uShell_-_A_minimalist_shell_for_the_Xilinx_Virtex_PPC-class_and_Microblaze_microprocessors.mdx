description: 'This sofftware has the potential to simplify testing, verification,
  and validation of future air-and-space-based instrument electronics designs. In
  recent years there has been a growing interest in using FPGA-based microprocessor
  designs for instrument electronics (see e.g. the funding task, SOAR, MSPI, PanFTS,
  ISAAC). As the FPGA technology at JPL matures from "glue-logic" chips to full-fledged
  instrument processors, we will need to improve our ability to test, verify, and
  validate these designs. '
