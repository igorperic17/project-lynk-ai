description: 'GMAT is a software system for trajectory optimization, mission analysis,
  trajectory estimation, and prediction. Analysts use GMAT to design spacecraft trajectories,
  optimize maneuvers, perform orbit determination, visualize and communicate mission
  parameters, and understand a mission&apos;s trade space. GMAT contains models of
  real-world objects such as spacecraft and thrusters, as well as analysis "objects"
  such as plots and reports. These objects are used in the mission sequence wherein
  the user employs commands supported by the system to model missions and perform
  estimation. Please visit the following URL for additional information: http://opensource.gsfc.nasa.gov/projects/GMAT/index.php'
