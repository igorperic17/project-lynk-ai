description: The Porous Microstructure Analysis (PuMA) software has been developed
  to compute effective material properties and perform material response simulations
  on digitized microstructures of porous media. PuMA is able to import digital three-dimensional
  images obtained from X-ray microtomography or to generate artificial microstructures
  that mimic real materials. PuMA also provides a module for interactive 3D visualizations.
  Version 3 includes modules to compute simple morphological properties such as porosity,
  volume fractions, pore diameter, and specific surface area. Additional capabilities
  include the determination of effective thermal and electrical conductivity (both
  radiative and solid conduction - including the ability to simulate local anisotropy
  for the latter); effective diffusivity and tortuosity from the continuum to the
  rarefied regime; techniques to determine the local material orientation, as well
  as the mechanical properties (elasticity coefficient), and the permeability of a
  material.
