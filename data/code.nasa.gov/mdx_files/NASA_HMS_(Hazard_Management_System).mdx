description: 'The Web-based, access-controlled NASA Hazard Management System (HMS)
  provides a centralized repository for hazards regardless of origin and offers the
  ability to report and manage real-time hazards and controls. The primary mechanism
  for identifying and documenting hazardous conditions within HMS lies in the creation
  and management of two types of analysis documents: Hazard Analyses (HAs) and Job
  Hazard Analyses (JHAs). While these two document types offer different approaches
  for hazard identification and classification, they both offer controls for mitigating
  hazards. HMS provides a framework within which HA and JHA documents are created,
  reviewed, and approved. Once approved, the hazardous conditions identified within
  a document are considered active. More important, the controls associated with the
  hazards are then also considered active. HMS includes the mechanisms required to
  evaluate hazards using standard Risk Assessment Code (RAC) scoring.'
