description: 'The Software Bus Network application (SBN) is a core Flight System (cFS)
  application that is a plug in to the Core Flight Executive (cFE) component of the
  cFS. The SBN serves as a plug-in to the cFE framework to transfer messages across
  process/processor interfaces. The technology has three primary functions: to establish
  and maintain a connection to each peer over available process/processor interfaces;
  to distribute and maintain a subscription message database for each peer; and to
  distribute messages to peers that have subscribed to message identifiers.'
