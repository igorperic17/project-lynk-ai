description: CORSAIR is a three-dimensional unsteady Navier-Stokes analysis used for
  solving flows in rotating turbomachinery components. CORGRD is the grid generator
  written to accompany the CORSAIR analysis. The grid generator produces overlaid
  O-H grids for rotating turbomachinery components, including those with tip clearance
  and varying endwall radii. WILDCAT is the two-dimensional counterpart of CORSAIR.
