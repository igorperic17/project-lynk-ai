description: The Advanced Life Support Sizing Analysis Tool (ALSSAT) is a computer
  model for sizing and analyzing designs of environmental-control and life support
  systems (ECLSS) for spacecraft and surface habitats involved in the exploration
  of Mars and the Moon. It performs conceptual designs of advanced life support (ALS)
  subsystems that recycle air and water and process wastes in order to reduce the
  need for resource resupply. ALSSAT is a means of investigating combinations of such
  subsystems' technologies and thereby assists in determining the most cost-effective
  technology combination available. Using the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet software
  with Visual Basic programming language, ALSSAT has been developed to perform multiple-case
  trade studies based on the calculated ECLSS mass, volume, power, and Equivalent
  System Mass, as well as parametric studies by varying the input parameters. ALSSAT's
  modular format is specifically designed for the ease of future maintenance and upgrades.
