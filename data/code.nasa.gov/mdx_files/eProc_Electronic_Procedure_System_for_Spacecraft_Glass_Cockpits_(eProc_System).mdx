description: Crew members have the ability to perform all display tasks manually or
  with electronic procedures. This electronic procedure system, referred to as eProc,
  is designed as a powerful alternative to reduce crew workload. eProc assists crew
  members by highlighting vehicle states on a display and cueing up appropriate displays,
  pop-ups, and commands. eProc is also linked to fault messages, so that crew members
  can quickly access procedures to any message that appears on the fault summary or
  log displays.
