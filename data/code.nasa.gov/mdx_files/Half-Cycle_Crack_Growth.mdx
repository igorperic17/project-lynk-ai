description: This NASA-developed software program predicts the operational flight
  life of critical aero-structural components. The tool offers a reliable method for
  calculating theoretical fatigue crack growths that could lead to catastrophic structural
  component failures. The program builds upon and integrates Armstrong's proven half-cycle
  and closed-form aging theories and is especially accurate because it considers every
  half-cycle of loading spectra for specific structural components. The program works
  by reading test data files and determining maximum and minimum loads of each half-cycle
  of random loading spectra in order to calculate theoretical crack growth. The innovation
  is an improvement on traditional prediction software (and in particular on visual
  inspections) because it considers mini-amplitude stress loading and half-cycles
  based on the duty cycle of a particular component or structure.
