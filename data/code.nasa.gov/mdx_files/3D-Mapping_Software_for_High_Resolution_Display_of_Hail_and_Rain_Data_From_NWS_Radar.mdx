description: A three-dimensional high resolution mapping of hail, as well as rain,
  is desirable in many instances.  For example, hail mapping in the vicinity of a
  vehicle on the launch pad would help determine whether or not damage may have occurred
  due to a hail event.  In addition to quantifying the size and quantity of hail,
  it is desirable to know where on the vehicle hail impacts may have occurred.  High
  resolution display of weather radar data using the software described in this report
  can be used to generate a 3D hail/rain map around a large structure, such as the
  launch pad or a power plant.
