description: "The communication module of ICAROUS enables data transfer between ICAROUS\
  \ and other off board entities, e.g., ground stations, other air traffic, via the\
  \ open source MAVLink protocol (http://qgroundcontrol.org/mavlink/start).  The decision\
  \ making module of ICAROUS provides a framework to monitor incoming data from aircraft\
  \ sensors and data links for conflicts, e.g., violations of keep-in/keep-out regions,\
  \ collision hazards, weather hazards, and resolve these conflicts with the help\
  \ of the core ICAROUS algorithms.\r\n"
