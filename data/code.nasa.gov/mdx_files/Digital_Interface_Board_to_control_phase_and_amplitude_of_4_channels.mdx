description: The digital interface board will control the phase and amplitude of the
  signals for each element in the array.  A host computer running Agilent VEE sends
  commands via serial UART connection to a Xilinx VirtexII FPGA.  The commands are
  decoded and either outputs are set or telemetry data is sent back to the host computer
  describing the status and the current phase and amplitude settings.
