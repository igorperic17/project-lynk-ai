description: The Drought Severity Assessment Tool (formerly Drought Severity Assessment
  - Decision Support Tool) will be used by Navajo Nation Department of Water Resource
  Managers for their monthly drought reports and other activities related to drought

  to be used in other locations given the user has already downloaded and processed
