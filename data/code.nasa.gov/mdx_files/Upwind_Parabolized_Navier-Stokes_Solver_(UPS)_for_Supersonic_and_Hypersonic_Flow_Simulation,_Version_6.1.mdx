description: This software provides a means for simulating supersonic and hypersonic
  flows efficiently and accurately (under certain restrictions). The parabolized Navier-Stokes
  (PNS) equations are solved using an upwind finite-volume algorithm that is implicit
  in the marching direction. The solver includes models for turbulent flow and equilibrium-
  and finite-rate air chemistry.
