description: 'This RCS Model is a C language program. It contains two main functions:
  (1) The RCS electronics model function which models the RCS FPGA processing and
  commanding of the RCS valve. (2) The RCS dynamic model function, which models the
  valve and combustion dynamics. This functions need to be called within the simulation
  executive. In addition, it provides support functions to initialize the model, set
  parameters, access model telemetry, access calculated thruster forcers. '
