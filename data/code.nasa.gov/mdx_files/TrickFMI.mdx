description: 'This software supports FMI based model exchange with Trick based simulations.
  The Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) standard was developed in partnership with
  governmental, academic and commercial entities in the European Union. This standard
  is used to support the exchange of component models for complex system simulations
  throughout Europe and the United States. Trick simulations are used all across NASA
  for simulations that support human spaceflight activities. However, until now, there
  were no means to use FMI based models in a Trick based simulation or a method for
  providing Trick based models that were FMI compliant. This software provides implementation
  software to do both. There are two principal components to the software: A C based
  software implementation for wrapping Trick based C models that provide an FMI compliant
  interface; A collection of C++ classes that can be used in a Trick based simulation
  to use an FMI compliant model (FMU).'
