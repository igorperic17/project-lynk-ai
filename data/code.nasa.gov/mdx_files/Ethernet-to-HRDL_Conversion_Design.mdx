description: The International Space Station (ISS) uses a fiber-optic High Rate Data
  Link (HRDL) standard for transferring data. Those designing ISS experiments, however,
  may prefer an Ethernet interface. This design allows ISS instruments to keep their
  Ethernet interface by converting the Ethernet data format into a format compatible
  with the ISS.
