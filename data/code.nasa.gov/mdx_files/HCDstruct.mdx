description: This MATLAB routine generates a scalable finite element model suitable
  for hybrid wing-body (HWB) structural analysis and optimization. HWB geometry structure
  is based on a vehicle sketch-pad (VSP) surface model of an aircraft and a FLOPS-compatible
  parameterization of the center body and wing structure. Optimization and weight
  calculation are based on a Nastran finite element analysis of the primary structural
  components.
