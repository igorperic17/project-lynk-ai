description: This MATLAB software first reads in temperature data measured from two
  thermocouples embedded in a heat conducting specimen. The software also reads in
  the thermophysical properties for the heat conducting specimen. After filtering
  noise from the measured temperature data, the software then uses the filtered data
  and thermophysical properties to solve both a direct and inverse heat conduction
  problem to estimate both temperature and heat flux on the external surface of the
  specimen.
