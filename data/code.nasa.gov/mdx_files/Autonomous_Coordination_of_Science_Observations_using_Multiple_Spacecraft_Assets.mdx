description: This autonomous science system for multiple spacecraft assets was integrated
  with the Interplanetary Network DTN (Delay Tolerant Network) to provide communication
  between spacecraft assets. The full integrated system was then demonstrated at the
  JPL Mars Yard where it was shown to autonomously coordinate observations between
  multiple spacecraft, including a field test rover, multiple fixed landed assets,
  and multiple field test orbiters.
