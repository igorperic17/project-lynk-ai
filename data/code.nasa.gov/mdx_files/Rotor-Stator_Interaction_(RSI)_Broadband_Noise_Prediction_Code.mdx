description: RSI is a Fortran computer code for calculating the spectrum of broadband
  noise produced by the interaction of fan-rotor wake turbulence with fan-exit guide
  vanes (i.e., the stator). Provided with incident-turbulence characteristics, the
  code computes the spectra of acoustic power upstream and downstream of the stator
  on a mode-by-mode basis at each frequency of interest. Target frequencies are arbitrary
  and need not be harmonics of a fan's blade-passing frequency.
