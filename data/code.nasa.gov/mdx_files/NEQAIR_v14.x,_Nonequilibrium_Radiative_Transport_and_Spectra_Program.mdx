description: "NEQAIR  is a line-by-line radiation code that computes spontaneous emission,\
  \ absorption and stimulated emission due to transitions between various energy states\
  \ of chemical species along a line-of-sight.  \r\nNEQAIR v14.0 is a complex code\
  \ that enables the calculation of: (1) Nonequlibrium or equilibrium populations\
  \ of excited energy levels for atomic and diatomic molecules, (2) Optical radiation\
  \ emitted and absorbed by atomic and diatomic rotational lines along a line-of-sight\
  \ or across a shock tube, (3)Transport of optical radiation through a non uniform\
  \ gas mixture to a solid surface and (4) Detailed spectra at points along a line-of-sight\
  \ and at a surface and plots them.\r\n"
