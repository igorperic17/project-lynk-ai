project_description: "SMART seeks to empower females and minorities to use science and engineering to research water quality in their local watershed. Students engage in numerous science and technology fields: engineering design, data acquisition, analysis and visualization, chemistry, environmental science, biology, and information technology. Students also connect with a diversity of professionals in water and engineering in government, private firms and non-profits. Dedicated mentors support SMART students as they research water issues within their communities. SMART began in the State of Maine. Now, through an NSF INCLUDES grant, SMART has expanded to eight states (New York, North Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, Idaho, and California), where partners are designing stormwater-themed projects that address their location and demographic specific needs."

# SMART (Stormwater Management Research Team): Creating a Diverse STEM Pathway with Community Water Research
