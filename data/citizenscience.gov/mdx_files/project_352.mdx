project_description: "The Digital Earth Watch (DEW) Picture Post Network empowers citizens to observe and measure changes in natural areas that are important to them by taking and sharing repeat digital photographs from picture post platforms that they set up and maintain. Photographic observations are used to monitor and measure changes in the local landscape in response to climate. Often, changes in the landscape are so subtle that we cannot see them without the help of modern technology. Picture Post provides a means for anyone to collect their own data, measure environmental change in their neighborhood, and contribute to a national database by sharing their photos on the Picture Post website. Every community can tell their story using Picture Post."
