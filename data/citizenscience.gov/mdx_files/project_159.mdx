The Bioblitz event will focus on specific species and critical habitat areas rather than an all-taxa inventory to best serve the resource stewardship goals of the park and inform management decisions. Additionally, educational hands-on activities and booths will enhance the event and foster stewardship and learning for participants and the greater community."
