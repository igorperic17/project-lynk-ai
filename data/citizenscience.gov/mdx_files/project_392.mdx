# Arizona BatWatch

Scientists know very little about the behaviors of bats in the wild including the endangered lesser long-nosed bat which pollinates agave and southwestern cacti. Participants help scientists learn about the behavior of lesser long-nosed bats by watching videos of the bats flying around their roost and tagging the behaviors they see.
