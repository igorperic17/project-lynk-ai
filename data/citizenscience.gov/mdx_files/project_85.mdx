# Social Science Study: What do you value on Georgia’s Coast? Measuring and Mapping the Social Values of Ecosystem Services off of Georgia’s Coast

Gray&#39;s Reef National Marine Sanctuary volunteers are invited to participate as surveyors conducting a confidential social science assessment of pedestrians at predetermined public interface points along the Georgia coast. NOAA is interested in determining the attitudes, knowledge, and perceptions of residents and users about the environmental condition of the Georgia coast, and determining where and how residents, users, and visitors value the Georgia coast. We will do this by surveying residents, visitors,anglers, boaters, hunters, bird watchers, campers, etc. at publicly accessible areas utilizing provided survey tools and methodology. This research study, prepared by the NOAA NCCOS Hollings Marine Laboratory for Gray&#39;s Reef National Marine Sanctuary and Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve, has been approved by the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB Code:0648-0687).
