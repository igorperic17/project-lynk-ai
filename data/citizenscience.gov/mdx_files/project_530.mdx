Data collection may involve both the collection of new field measurements and the identification and aggregation of existing data from a range of potential sources. EPA will provide a short and simple electronic survey form that allows volunteers to contribute data.  EPA scientists will provide descriptions of the types of relevant data, how these data can be collected in the field (based on availability of equipment), quality assurance procedures that should be followed, instructions for reporting data, and details about how contributed data will (and will not) be used by the Agency."

# National Groundwater Resource Survey

This project, currently in the planning phase, will crowdsource collection of hydrogeologic data (e.g.,  depth to groundwater, hydraulic conductivity) from across the United States and territories. Data collection may involve both the collection of new field measurements and the identification and aggregation of existing data from a range of potential sources. EPA will provide a short and simple electronic survey form that allows volunteers to contribute data.  EPA scientists will provide descriptions of the types of relevant data, how these data can be collected in the field (based on availability of equipment), quality assurance procedures that should be followed, instructions for reporting data, and details about how contributed data will (and will not) be used by the Agency.
