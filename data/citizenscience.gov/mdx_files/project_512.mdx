# NCI-DOE Collaboration 2020 Virtual Ideas Lab: Towards Building a Cancer Patient ‘Digital Twin’

Since 2016, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) have been collaborating in the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) program to simultaneously accelerate advances in predictive oncology and scientific computing. A multidisciplinary community arose from that collaboration and identified aspirational cancer challenges that require shared efforts across cancer research, artificial intelligence, and advanced computing technologies. Digital twin technology is one of those challenges. In July 2020, 30 multidisciplinary scientists participated in a five-day interactive event, the NCI-DOE Collaboration Virtual Ideas Lab: Toward Building a Cancer Patient &#39;Digital Twin&#39;. They formed new collaborations and created innovative research projects focusing on a digital twin component that, within the next 2-3 years, will advance the development of a model of an individual cancer patient.
