# Barcode Long Island: Exploring Biodiversity in a Unique Urban Landscape

From barcodeli.org/about.html: Working with a qualified teacher, teams of 2-4 high school students first propose a project using DNA barcoding to study biodiversity on Long Island. Once approved, BLI provides all the training, equipment, materials, and infrastructure needed to support these projects, which will be combined into a large-scale student-driven research effort.
