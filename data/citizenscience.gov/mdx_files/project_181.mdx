# pH Pro

Collect pH coastal data easily with a device that links to smart phone. pH photometer will deliver 0.01 pH accuracy, and it includes salinity and temperature probes all at a low cost to allow citizen scientists access.  This device is being interfaced with a smart phone app and ultimately a website to allow transfer and visualization of data for scientists, students, and citizen scientists.
