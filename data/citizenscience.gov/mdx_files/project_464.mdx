# Rim Fire Monitoring

In 2013, the Rim Fire burned more than 400 square miles in and around Yosemite National Park. A lot of that burned area was in the Stanislaus National Forest. Nerds for Nature teamed up with National Forest staff and the nonprofit Wholly H2O to install a dozen signs around the forest, in the largest and most permanent Change Brackets installation yet!
