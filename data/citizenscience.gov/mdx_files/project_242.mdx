It has since grown into a collaborative effort of over 700 local and national organizations all volunteering together to establish community and school gardens across the country. The simple act of planting a garden can help unite neighborhoods in a common effort and inspire voluntary, locally-led solutions to challenges facing our country - from hunger to the environment. The majority of garden construction, maintenance, harvest, data gathering, information sharing, is done by volunteer students, teachers and master gardeners. They&#39;ve built over 2000 gardens, volunteered 222,000 hours and harvested over 3.9 million pounds of produce donated to local food banks."

# USDA Peopleâ€™s Garden

Secretary Tom Vilsack began the People&#39;s Garden Initiative - named in honor of President Lincoln&#39;s description of USDA as the  People&#39;s Department  - in 2009 as an effort to challenge employees to create gardens at USDA facilities.
