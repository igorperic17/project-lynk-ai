project_description: "This project is focused on improving air quality and human health in Pittsburgh, particularly in Environmental Justice communities. Multiple real-time, affordable, multipollutant (RAMP) air monitors and high-resolution air quality modeling will provide localized information, instead of generalizing pollutant levels for all of Pittsburgh. Carnegie Mellon University researchers are partnering with three local community groups to investigate the accuracy and reliability of existing sensors and their potential effectiveness in helping communities understand local levels of air pollutants and how to respond."

# Democratization of Measurement and Modeling Tools for Community Action on Air Quality, and Improved Spatial Resolution of Air Pollutant Concentrations

This project is focused on improving air quality and human health in Pittsburgh, particularly in Environmental Justice communities. Multiple real-time, affordable, multipollutant (RAMP) air monitors and high-resolution air quality modeling will provide localized information, instead of generalizing pollutant levels for all of Pittsburgh. Carnegie Mellon University researchers are partnering with three local community groups to investigate the accuracy and reliability of existing sensors and their potential effectiveness in helping communities understand local levels of air pollutants and how to respond.
