project_description: "MAPPPD is a one-stop shop for information on penguin abundance and distribution in the Antarctic that integrates citizen science, expert biological field surveys, and satellite imagery to provide data required for Antarctic decision support and conservation assessment. Tens of thousands of tourists go to Antarctica each year; their observations on the presence and absence of wildlife is critical to informing models of biogeography and our understanding of species range shifts through time. Antarctic stakeholders can use MAPPPD to search and select sites of interest, get estimates of abundance in areas of interest, and explore how these abundance estimates are predicted to change with time."

# Mapping Application for Penguin Populations and Projected Dynamics (MAPPPD)

MAPPPD is a one-stop shop for information on penguin abundance and distribution in the Antarctic that integrates citizen science, expert biological field surveys, and satellite imagery to provide data required for Antarctic decision support and conservation assessment. Tens of thousands of tourists go to Antarctica each year; their observations on the presence and absence of wildlife is critical to informing models of biogeography and our understanding of species range shifts through time. Antarctic stakeholders can use MAPPPD to search and select sites of interest, get estimates of abundance in areas of interest, and explore how these abundance estimates are predicted to change with time.
