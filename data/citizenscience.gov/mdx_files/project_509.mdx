project_description: "The Distance Transcriber Volunteer Program at Longfellow House-Washington&#39;s Headquarters NHS increases digital access to the rich letters and journals in the park&#39;s archives. Volunteers from around the country are given access to scans of historic documents and asked to transcribe them, puzzling out 19th century handwriting. This crowd-sourcing project enables the park to increase access to the archives while reducing in-person use and potential damage to this valuable collection. Since the start of the program in March 2020, the park has signed up 25 volunteers - everyone from a family transcribing together during COVID, to teachers stuck at home."

This crowd-sourcing project enables the park to increase access to the archives while reducing in-person use and potential damage to this valuable collection. Since the start of the program in March 2020, the park has signed up 25 volunteers - everyone from a family transcribing together during COVID, to teachers stuck at home.
