# Foldit Game Empowering the Citizen Scientist in the Fight Against Ebolaviruses

The goal of this project is to engage the Foldit community in a collaborative citizen science effort to address the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa. We intend to improve the Foldit game-based scientific environment towards rapid and direct collaboration between the Foldit community, UW Institute for Protein Design (IPD), and UW Center for Game Science.
