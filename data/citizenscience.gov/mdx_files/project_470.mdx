# Monitoring the Air in Our Community: Engaging Citizens in Research

National Jewish Health and RTI International are teaming up with the City of Denver, Groundwork Denver, and Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to learn how communities can use personal air quality monitors to understand air pollution and take action to protect their health. Taking place in Denver’s Globeville and Elyria/Swansea neighborhoods, this study aims to facilitate citizen’s understanding of their air quality exposure, both outside and in their home environment. As part of this study, citizen scientists will engage with data collection and analytics through written reports and smart phone applications, and will receive exposure coaching, in an effort to cultivate data understanding, encourage actions for exposure reduction, and guide informational preferences for the future.
