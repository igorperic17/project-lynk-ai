project_description: "The S&#39;COOL Project involves people (ages 5-99) in real science, taking and reporting ground truth observations of clouds to assist in the validation of NASA&#39;s Clouds and the Earth&#39;s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments. CERES  is an important tool for scientists who study how atmospheric moisture affects our weather and climate. The observations made by S&#39;COOL help to provide another piece of the puzzle. The project, which began in 1997, is coordinated with satellites that carry CERES instruments as well as geostationary weather satellites. S&#39;COOL was developed from the beginning in coordination with teachers who sought a safe, simple and cheap way to unite students with NASA. In 2008 technology advances enabled S&#39;COOL to accept observations from citizen scientists anywhere in the world. Since 2016, S&#39;COOL is integrated with GLOBE cloud observations, but still accepts observations directly from non-GLOBE countries. GLOBE countries submit their cloud observations through NASA GLOBE Clouds - https://www.globe.gov/web/s-cool."

# Studentsâ€™ Cloud observations On-Line

The S&#39;COOL Project involves people (ages 5-99) in real science, taking and reporting ground truth observations of clouds to assist in the validation of NASA&#39;s Clouds and the Earth&#39;s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments. CERES  is an important tool for scientists who study how atmospheric moisture affects our weather and climate. The observations made by S&#39;COOL help to provide another piece of the puzzle. The project, which began in 1997, is coordinated with satellites that carry CERES instruments as well as geostationary weather satellites. S&#39;COOL was developed from the beginning in coordination with teachers who sought a safe, simple and cheap way to unite students with NASA. In 2008 technology advances enabled S&#39;COOL to accept observations from citizen scientists anywhere in the world. Since 2016, S&#39;COOL is integrated with GLOBE cloud observations, but still accepts observations directly from non-GLOBE countries.
