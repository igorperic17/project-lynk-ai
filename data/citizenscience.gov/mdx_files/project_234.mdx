# JunoCam

When NASA&#39;s Juno mission arrives at Jupiter on July 4, 2016, new views of the planet will be sent back to Earth, courtesy of its color camera, called JunoCam. The public will act as a virtual imaging team, participating in key steps of the process. Amateur astronomers are invited to submit images of Jupiter from their own telescopes. These views are the basis for online discussions about what JunoCam should image as it passes over the planet. After Juno arrives at Jupiter, the public will process the images to create color pictures.
