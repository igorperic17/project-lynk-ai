# Mountain Rain or Snow

Itâ€™s notoriously difficult to research winter precipitation in the mountains as precipitation phase (rain, snow, or mixed) can vary over the course of minutes and across short distances. Human observers are our best resource for discovering how rain and snow vary in time and space. Mountain Rain or Snow is a citizen science project devoted to collecting real-time observations of precipitation phase.
