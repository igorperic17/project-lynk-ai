project_description: "The American Pika is a charismatic mammal that is sensitive to climate-driven variation in temperature, snowpack, and vegetation composition. Extirpation of pika populations has been linked to climate change in the Great Basin, Southern Utah and California. The species may be more resilient to climate change in high-elevation habitat in Colorado. However, recent research predicts that pikas may be extirpated from Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) by 2100 under some climate change scenarios. There is a pressing need to assess the species&#39; vulnerability to climate change across Colorado. The White River National Forest (WRNF) and the Front Range Pika Project (FRPP) are engaging citizen scientists in field surveys to determine the status of pika populations as an indicator of alpine ecosystem integrity. They are collecting data to determine pika distribution, improve understanding of environmental variables that limit pika distribution, and predict and track the species&#39; response to climate change."

Data will inform landscape-scale assessment of pika vulnerability to environmental change."

# Field Research on American Pika, an Indicator Species for Alpine Ecosystem Integrity

The American Pika is a charismatic mammal that is sensitive to climate-driven variation in temperature, snowpack, and vegetation composition. Extirpation of pika populations has been linked to climate change in the Great Basin, Southern Utah and California. The species may be more resilient to climate change in high-elevation habitat in Colorado. However, recent research predicts that pikas may be extirpated from Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) by 2100 under some climate change scenarios. There is a pressing need to assess the species&#39; vulnerability to climate change across Colorado. The White River National Forest (WRNF) and the Front Range Pika Project (FRPP) are engaging citizen scientists in field surveys to determine the status of pika populations as an indicator of alpine ecosystem integrity. They are collecting data to determine pika distribution, improve understanding of environmental variables that limit pika distribution, and predict and track the species&#39; response to climate change.
