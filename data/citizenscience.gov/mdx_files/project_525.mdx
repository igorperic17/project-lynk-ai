project_description: "Accurate air quality measurements are the foundation of regulatory programs that reduce air pollution. Recent improvements in sensor technology allow volunteer citizens scientists to measure air pollution in their communities. However, a challenge is that the quality of data obtained from low-cost air sensors often is not equal to more expensive monitors used by government agencies. A cost-effective way to assess the performance of low-cost air sensors (and create data correction equations that make sensor data comparable to government monitors) is to test low-cost sensors near the more expensive technology at regulatory monitoring sites. This project sets up small testing enclosures that will be set up at regulatory air monitoring sites. It will fund construction of air sensor shelters, to be set up on or near tribal lands, that can be used by tribal, state and local air monitoring agencies. Tribal environmental agencies and citizen science organizations can use these air sensor testing shelters to conduct air sensor projects. Placement of collocated testing shelters at existing regulatory air monitoring sites allows for direct data comparisons between low- cost sensors and more expensive monitoring technology - a recommended method in EPA guidance for assessing air sensor measurement accuracy and uncertainty."

# Improving Tribal and Citizen Science with Collocated Low-Cost Air Sensor Shelters

Accurate air quality measurements are the foundation of regulatory programs that reduce air pollution. Recent improvements in sensor technology allow volunteer citizens scientists to measure air pollution in their communities. However, a challenge is that the quality of data obtained from low-cost air sensors often is not equal to more expensive monitors used by government agencies. A cost-effective way to assess the performance of low-cost air sensors (and create data correction equations that make sensor data comparable to government monitors) is to test low-cost sensors near the more expensive technology at regulatory monitoring sites. This project sets up small testing enclosures that will be set up at regulatory air monitoring sites. It will fund construction of air sensor shelters, to be set up on or near tribal lands, that can be used by tribal, state and local air monitoring agencies. Tribal environmental agencies and citizen science organizations can use these air sensor testing shelters to conduct air sensor projects. Placement of collocated testing shelters at existing regulatory air monitoring sites allows for direct data comparisons between low- cost sensors and more expensive monitoring technology - a recommended method in EPA guidance for assessing air sensor measurement accuracy and uncertainty.
