# Plant Census at Smithsonianâ€™s Global Change Research Wetland

Scientists have been studying the marsh at the Global Change Research Wetlands for nearly 30 years to track the impacts of carbon dioxide and nutrients on plant growth.  Citizen scientists work in the marsh to count and measure all of the plants in the experimental plots and work in the lab to analyze samples.
