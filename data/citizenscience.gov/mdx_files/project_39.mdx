# Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) Program

The Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) Program provides a central repository for spatially referenced biogeographic accounts of nonindigenous aquatic species in the USA. It includes verified occurrences, distribution maps, and species profiles for freshwater nonindigenous aquatic animal and plant species. Citizens can report a nonnative species through an online reporting form.
