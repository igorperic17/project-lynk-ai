Citizen scientists learn to identify their local frogs and toads by their unique breeding vocalizations and then conduct frog call surveys at predetermined locations (adopt a survey route). Data are collected using a calling survey technique, in which volunteers identify local amphibian species by their unique breeding vocalizations or calls."

# North American Amphibian Monitoring Program

Purpose of the project is to assess population change for frogs and toads.  Citizen scientists learn to identify their local frogs and toads by their unique breeding vocalizations and then conduct frog call surveys at predetermined locations (adopt a survey route). Data are collected using a calling survey technique, in which volunteers identify local amphibian species by their unique breeding vocalizations or calls.
