project_description: "The Dolphin &amp; Whale 911 app will enhance accurate and timely reporting of stranded marine mammals in the Southeastern U.S. NOAA Fisheries is faced with numerous challenges to enhance the protection, conservation, and management of marine mammals. One of the main challenges is the lack of public awareness about how to report stranded marine mammals. When the public is unaware of how to contact their local Stranding Network, response can be delayed, compromising the animal\u2019s chance of survival and/or limiting the amount of valuable data collected from dead animals. By providing valuable information on smartphones, including a colorful species identification guide, the public will know who to call and what to do when they find a sick, injured or dead marine mammal, thus contributing to marine mammal conservation."

The Dolphin &amp; Whale 911 app will enhance accurate and timely reporting of stranded marine mammals in the Southeastern U.S. NOAA Fisheries is faced with numerous challenges to enhance the protection, conservation, and management of marine mammals. One of the main challenges is the lack of public awareness about how to report stranded marine mammals. When the public is unaware of how to contact their local Stranding Network, response can be delayed, compromising the animalâ€™s chance of survival and/or limiting the amount of valuable data collected from dead animals. By providing valuable information on smartphones, including a colorful species identification guide, the public will know who to call and what to do when they find a sick, injured or dead marine mammal, thus contributing to marine mammal conservation.
