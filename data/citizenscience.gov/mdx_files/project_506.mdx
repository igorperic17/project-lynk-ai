# Town Brook Restoration

The NOAA Restoration Center has been supporting the Town of Plymouth for just over 20 years to remove 5 dams and enhance fish passage at a 6th dam on Town Brook in order to restore diadromous runs of river herring, American eel and rainbow smelt.  The final dam removal was completed in 2019.  As part of the project NOAA provided funding to install an underwater camera that allows for citizen scientists to count returning herring in order to determine the annual run size.
