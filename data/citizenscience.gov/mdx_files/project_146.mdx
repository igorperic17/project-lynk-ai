project_description: "Theodore Roosevelt had a passion for nature, especially birds.  He made a serious study of birds as a child, collecting bird skins and nests, and keeping lists of the species that he observed. Theodore Roosevelt chose to build his home in Oyster Bay partly for the opportunity to observe the diverse local wildlife and to experience healthful outdoor exercise. This Centennial Birdblitz will give people the opportunity to enjoy the hearty outdoor life that Theodore Roosevelt enjoyed while compiling a list of the bird species present at Sagamore Hill today.  It has been over ten years since the last bird survey and seeing what change has occurred in the bird populations will be interesting and valuable, especially in the context of climate change."

# 2016 National Parks BioBlitz - Sagamore Hill BirdBlitz

Theodore Roosevelt had a passion for nature, especially birds.  He made a serious study of birds as a child, collecting bird skins and nests, and keeping lists of the species that he observed. Theodore Roosevelt chose to build his home in Oyster Bay partly for the opportunity to observe the diverse local wildlife and to experience healthful outdoor exercise. This Centennial Birdblitz will give people the opportunity to enjoy the hearty outdoor life that Theodore Roosevelt enjoyed while compiling a list of the bird species present at Sagamore Hill today.  It has been over ten years since the last bird survey and seeing what change has occurred in the bird populations will be interesting and valuable, especially in the context of climate change.
