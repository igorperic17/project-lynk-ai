project_description: "Volunteers can help scientists understand the effects of climate change on baldcypress swamps. Rising levels of carbon dioxide have been linked to increases in temperatures in North America, and scientists need to understand better how well natural wetlands can pull gases from the atmosphere. You can help scientists at the USGS Wetland and Aquatic Research Center who are studying production levels in swamps to better understand if swamps can store the carbon that is present in the atmosphere."

# North American Baldcypress Swamp Network

Volunteers can help scientists understand the effects of climate change on baldcypress swamps. Rising levels of carbon dioxide have been linked to increases in temperatures in North America, and scientists need to understand better how well natural wetlands can pull gases from the atmosphere. You can help scientists at the USGS Wetland and Aquatic Research Center who are studying production levels in swamps to better understand if swamps can store the carbon that is present in the atmosphere.
