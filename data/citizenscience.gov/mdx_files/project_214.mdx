project_description: "Gardenroots was developed by M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez-Andreotta, Superfund Research Program Training Core graduate student and former Research Translation Coordinator. She created the project in response to home gardening concerns in the Dewey-Humboldt, AZ community over possible metal contamination from the neighboring Iron King Mine and Humboldt Smelter Superfund site. The overall objective of Gardenroots was to determine whether home garden vegetables grown in Dewey-Humboldt had elevated levels of arsenic. By building co-created public participation in a scientific research program, this project also looked to educate, build human capacity, and increase community networking in resource-related issues in the community."

# Gardenroots

Gardenroots was developed by Mónica Ramírez-Andreotta, Superfund Research Program Training Core graduate student and former Research Translation Coordinator. She created the project in response to home gardening concerns in the Dewey-Humboldt, AZ community over possible metal contamination from the neighboring Iron King Mine and Humboldt Smelter Superfund site. The overall objective of Gardenroots was to determine whether home garden vegetables grown in Dewey-Humboldt had elevated levels of arsenic. By building co-created public participation in a scientific research program, this project also looked to educate, build human capacity, and increase community networking in resource-related issues in the community.
