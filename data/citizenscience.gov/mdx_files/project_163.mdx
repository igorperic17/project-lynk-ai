The efforts of the CEIU, in addition to ICEâ€™s participation in national programs like Operation Predator and international partnerships like the Virtual Global Taskforce, have resulted in the rescue of thousands of children.  The program encourages law enforcement and the public at large to report suspected child predators and suspicious activities through toll-free hot lines and a mobile phone application.
