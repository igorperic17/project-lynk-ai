# Citizen Science Booklet

Visitors can complete the Citizen Science Booklet during their visit to Craters of the Moon. To complete the booklet visitors observe Pika habitat, compare sounds in two different soundscapes, count Clark&#39;s Nutcrackers, look for Limber Pine cones, and rate air quality. Visitors return their data to the park when they are finished.
