project_description: "The purpose of SMAP-SOC is to provide BLM natural resource managers with an application to model the current and future distributions of freshwater species of concern (SOC), across large management regions. These models will be based on occurrences from both crowdsourced data and detections using environmental DNA (e-DNA). These occurrences will then be related to Earth observations and other spatial data so distributions can be predicted across landscapes."

# System for Mapping and Predicting Species of Concern

The purpose of SMAP-SOC is to provide BLM natural resource managers with an application to model the current and future distributions of freshwater species of concern (SOC), across large management regions. These models will be based on occurrences from both crowdsourced data and detections using environmental DNA (e-DNA). These occurrences will then be related to Earth observations and other spatial data so distributions can be predicted across landscapes.
