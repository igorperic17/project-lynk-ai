The GeoCenter&#39;s Mapping for Resilience Program empowers youth in developing countries to create foundational geospatial data and makes it available through the OpenStreetMap platform for everyone to access. Students and their faculty advisors are invited to join YouthMappers, an international university consortium that organizes a global community of learners, researchers, educators, and scholars to create and use open geographic data that directly address locally defined development challenges worldwide.  Our vision is a global network of university students that create geospatial data for USAID programs in an open environment so it is also available for the greater public good.
