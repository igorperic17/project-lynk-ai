(DYSI) - Report a Landslide is a website developed by the USGS Landslide Hazards Program that asks anyone who saw a landslide anywhere in the country to report their observations.

Every year, landslides cost the nation 1 to 2 billion dollars in damage. Falling rocks, mud, and debris flows are one of the most common and sometimes deadly hazards faced by all U.S. citizens, yet there is still a lot we do not know about how and why they happen. Now, scientists at the USGS are asking the public to help them track landslides to better understand how to protect lives and property."

# Did You See It? - Report a Landslide

Did You See It? (DYSI) - Report a Landslide is a website developed by the USGS Landslide Hazards Program that asks anyone who saw a landslide anywhere in the country to report their observations.
