project_description: "With the free Whale Alert app, mariners and members of the public are provided with a user-friendly tool directly on their smartphone or tablet (Apple or Android).  Originally created by the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, Whale Alert visualizes whale conservation and management information on digital nautical charts, making them readily available. The app also allows the user to report any live, dead, or distressed whale sightings to the appropriate response agency; thus making this app an important tool for reducing ship strike threat to all whale species.  In addition to the eastern seaboard of the US, Whale Alert is now active on the US west coast, Alaska and Maritime Canada.  Partners include Conserve IO, International Fund for Animal Welfare, National Marine Fisheries Service and the New England Aquarium."
