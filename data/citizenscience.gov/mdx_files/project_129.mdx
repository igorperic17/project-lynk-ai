We do this through the use of crowdsourcing, which means we gather information on stream stage or water levels from anyone willing to send us a text message of the water levels at their local stream to collect spatially distributed hydrologic data. These data are then available for anyone to then use, from Universities to Elementary schools, interested in studying hydrologic data."

# CrowdHydrology

The CrowdHydrology mission is to create freely available data on stream stage in a simple and inexpensive way. We do this through the use of crowdsourcing, which means we gather information on stream stage or water levels from anyone willing to send us a text message of the water levels at their local stream to collect spatially distributed hydrologic data. These data are then available for anyone to then use, from Universities to Elementary schools, interested in studying hydrologic data.
