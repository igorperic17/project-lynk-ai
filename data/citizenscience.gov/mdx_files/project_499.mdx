Many of these orphaned wells were drilled prior to state regulations of oil &amp; gas drilling, and have not been properly plugged. We will work with activists who provide the locations of wells they encounter, and we then use laser-based detection equipment to determine if the wells are actively leaking methane, a potent greenhouse gas."

# Orphan Well Location Survey

Using the Orphan Well Location Survey (OWLS), we aim to locate abandoned and orphaned oil and natural gas wells near across the United States that may not be registered in the state databases. Many of these orphaned wells were drilled prior to state regulations of oil &amp; gas drilling, and have not been properly plugged. We will work with activists who provide the locations of wells they encounter, and we then use laser-based detection equipment to determine if the wells are actively leaking methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
