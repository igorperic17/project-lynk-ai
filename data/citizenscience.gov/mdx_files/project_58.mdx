# Urban Watch

The Urban Watch Program monitors storm drain outfalls during the dry weather months to help cities understand sources of pollution that may be impacting local creeks and the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Volunteers perform field measurements for pH, temperature, and conductivity, and collect water samples that are then tested for ammonia, phosphate, chlorine and detergents using an EPA approved Storm Water Test Kit.
