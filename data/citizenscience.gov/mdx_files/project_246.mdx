project_description: "In 1998, the Watershed Education Summit (WES) began as a collaboration between three high schools in two different districts and the Eldorado National Forest.  Every September, students from Golden Sierra, El Dorado, Oak Ridge and Union Mine, and Pioneer High Schools travel to Union Valley Reservoir for the WES conference.  Working with specialists and teachers, they spend four days collecting physical and biological data about the creeks.  Creeks are monitored annually as part of this service learning conference. This year, the Summit expanded to include the South Fork of Long Canyon, a stream affected by the King Fire one year ago.  New reaches were identified and data points established for this year and future years for continued monitoring of post-fire watershed conditions."

# Eldorado National Forest Watershed Education Summit

In 1998, the Watershed Education Summit (WES) began as a collaboration between three high schools in two different districts and the Eldorado National Forest.  Every September, students from Golden Sierra, El Dorado, Oak Ridge and Union Mine, and Pioneer High Schools travel to Union Valley Reservoir for the WES conference.  Working with specialists and teachers, they spend four days collecting physical and biological data about the creeks.  Creeks are monitored annually as part of this service learning conference. This year, the Summit expanded to include the South Fork of Long Canyon, a stream affected by the King Fire one year ago.  New reaches were identified and data points established for this year and future years for continued monitoring of post-fire watershed conditions.
