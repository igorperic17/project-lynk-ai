project_description: "Invertebrates were our main focus of the 2013 National Geographic BioBlitz at the park. We had no park lists and only very superficial knowledge of this taxa at that point. We added almost 500 new invertebrate species to our park&#39;s list, and worked a collecting permit with Louisiana State Arthropod Museum, whom we would like to bring back and broaden their efforts for this event. Aquatic invertebrates in park waterways are an indicator of environmental health, and we would like to get a better handle on these species in the Barataria Preserve. Hoping to also get more specific pollinator information for the park&#39;s flora."

# 2016 National Parks BioBlitz - Jean Lafitte BugBlitz

Invertebrates were our main focus of the 2013 National Geographic BioBlitz at the park. We had no park lists and only very superficial knowledge of this taxa at that point. We added almost 500 new invertebrate species to our park&#39;s list, and worked a collecting permit with Louisiana State Arthropod Museum, whom we would like to bring back and broaden their efforts for this event. Aquatic invertebrates in park waterways are an indicator of environmental health, and we would like to get a better handle on these species in the Barataria Preserve. Hoping to also get more specific pollinator information for the park&#39;s flora.
