# Closing the Loop: Generating Disambiguating Paraphrases for Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Structurally Ambiguous Sentences

This project investigates methods of using natural language generation to automatically produce disambiguating paraphrases of structurally ambiguous sentences in order to enable crowd-sourcing of data for parser training and domain adaptation.
