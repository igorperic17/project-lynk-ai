# NC Candid Critters

Help us study wildlife by running a motion sensitive  camera trap  on your property or public land. You get to look through the animal pictures, then upload them to us. We will use the data to map trends in animal populations across the state and share the results with you. Starting in eastern counties of North Carolina for winter 2016, state-wide in the spring.
