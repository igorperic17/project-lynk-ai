project_description: "The QCN is a project that enables seismologic recordings by tapping into the vast network of computing of personal computers, laptops, and smart phones. Volunteers can connect small USB seismic sensors to their computers or use sensors internal to laptops or smart phones to record earthquakes. Data is then collected by a software application that sends seismograms back to a central server. The volunteers can then log in and see what earthquakes they have recorded through the project website."

# Quake Catcher Network

The QCN is a project that enables seismologic recordings by tapping into the vast network of computing of personal computers, laptops, and smart phones. Volunteers can connect small USB seismic sensors to their computers or use sensors internal to laptops or smart phones to record earthquakes. Data is then collected by a software application that sends seismograms back to a central server. The volunteers can then log in and see what earthquakes they have recorded through the project website.
