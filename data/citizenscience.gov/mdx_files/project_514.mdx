Tag reporting by industry is the primary means of data recovery and to date, nearly 40,000 tags have been returned by the fishing industry. It is one of the longest active tagging programs in the nation and is an example of successful cooperative research between researchers and industry, and citizen science to recover this valuable data. These tagging data are incredibly valuable and have been used to examine movement patterns, evaluate areal apportionment strategies of annual catch quota, validate ageing methods, examine growth, and have resulted in numerous scientific and management publications."
