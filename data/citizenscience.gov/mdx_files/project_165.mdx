# EyeWire

Based in the Seung Computational Neuroscience Lab at Princeton University, EyeWire investigators are solving the mysteries of the brain with the help of the public.  Over 150,000 people around the world have played what has been called a “3D neuroscience coloring book” — a puzzle game anyone can play without having any knowledge or experience in the field of neuroscience.  EyeWire researchers aim to eventually map the human brain, but for now they are starting with the retina.  Players are mapping the connections between retinal neurons, helping researchers understand how neurons process information.  Players have already helped researchers understand how a mammal can detect motion, which has remained a mystery — until now.  EyeWire researchers hope their work can lead to advances in blindness therapies, the development of retinal prosthestics, and other benefits.
