project_description: "EPA Regions and the communities they serve want to understand the air pollutant concentrations and potential pollution exposures in local-scale environments where people live and work. One way to do this is through the use of air quality sensor pods which are less expensive, portable monitoring equipment that can provide finer spatial and temporal resolution than is possible with traditional air monitoring.  This project will enable EPA Regions to conduct short term projects investigating local and regional air quality using air quality sensor pods borrowed from EPA\u2019s Office of Research and Development."

project_goals: "Fixed regulatory air monitoring networks may not capture local-scale air quality conditions within urban communities. Portable, lower-cost sensor pods can provide finer spatial and temporal resolution than is possible with traditional monitoring equipment. This project  gives EPA Regions the ability to borrow sensor pods to investigate local air quality."

# Regional Air Sensor Loan Program

EPA Regions and the communities they serve want to understand the air pollutant concentrations and potential pollution exposures in local-scale environments where people live and work. One way to do this is through the use of air quality sensor pods which are less expensive, portable monitoring equipment that can provide finer spatial and temporal resolution than is possible with traditional air monitoring.  This project will enable EPA Regions to conduct short term projects investigating local and regional air quality using air quality sensor pods borrowed from EPAâ€™s Office of Research and Development.
