# Classical Biological Control of the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (BMSB)

The BMSB is an introduced insect that is indigenous throughout Eastern Asia, and it is a serious pest of fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Our Citizen Science activities include having individual citizens participate in the research by allowing traps to be set on their properties and collecting BMSB in their houses or businesses.
