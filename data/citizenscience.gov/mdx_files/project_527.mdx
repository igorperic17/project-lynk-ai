project_description: "This global citizen science effort was aimed at having volunteers bury biochar samples in their local soil for a period of 3 to 6 months, and then retrieve these samples and return them to the USDA-ARS for analysis.  This project was unique in that it provided the opportunity to age the same biochar in various soils across the globe, which would not have been possible to achieve through normal research collaborations or projects."

# Biochar Soil Aging

This global citizen science effort was aimed at having volunteers bury biochar samples in their local soil for a period of 3 to 6 months, and then retrieve these samples and return them to the USDA-ARS for analysis.  This project was unique in that it provided the opportunity to age the same biochar in various soils across the globe, which would not have been possible to achieve through normal research collaborations or projects.
