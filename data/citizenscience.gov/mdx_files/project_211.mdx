# Operation Predator

The US Department of Homeland Security&#39;s Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has created a smartphone app – the first of its kind in U.S. federal law enforcement – designed to seek the public&#39;s help with fugitive and unknown suspect child predators. The Operation Predator app enables users to receive alerts about wanted predators, to share the information with friends via email and social media tools, and to provide information to Homeland Security Investigations by calling or submitting an online tip. Additionally, the app allows users to view news about arrests and prosecutions of child predators and additional resources about ICE and its global partners in the fight against child exploitation. The iOS version of the app can be downloaded from Apple&#39;s App Store and iTunes; the Android version is available on the Google Play store.
