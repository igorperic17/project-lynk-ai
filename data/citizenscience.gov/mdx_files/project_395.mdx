As part of the module students make and deploy model frogs that collect frog body temperature information from different microhabitats.  These data are used by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh to validate computer model predictions of amphibian disease outbreaks and their potential impacts on North American amphibian populations."

# Ectotherm ER: Frogs under the weather!

This is an educational module for middle and early high school age students that contains lessons about the links between climate change, animal physiology, and disease ecology.  As part of the module students make and deploy model frogs that collect frog body temperature information from different microhabitats.  These data are used by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh to validate computer model predictions of amphibian disease outbreaks and their potential impacts on North American amphibian populations.
