project_description: "First Flush is a storm drain monitoring program where volunteers collect water samples from storm drains during the first major rainstorm of the winter season.  Samples are collected from urban storm drains for analysis of bacteria, metals, nutrients, and suspended solids.  Field measurements are also collected for conductivity, pH, temperature and water clarity.  The goal of the program is to characterize the quality of water flowing into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary during the first major rainstorm of the winter season."
