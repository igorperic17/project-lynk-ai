# FCWC-NOAA Collaborative Water Quality Monitoring

In response to a particularly bad red tide on the Gulf coast of Florida, a group of commercial and recreational fishermen started to collect data during fishing trips. The volunteers take an instrument and take water column profiles in several locations which are turned into environmental bulletins.
