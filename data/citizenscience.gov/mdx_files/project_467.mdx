project_description: "This project will help to identify and document the biodiversity of the Kaibab National Forest in the calendar year 2017. We invite forest staff and visitors to discover and report the plants and animals they see, and to contribute this information to improve our understanding of the abundance and distribution of species in the Kaibab NF. You might even find something new! Through this platform Kaibab National Forest biologists will help you identify your findings.
