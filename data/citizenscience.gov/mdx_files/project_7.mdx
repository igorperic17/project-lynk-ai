# Disk Detective

NASA astrophysicists need your help finding new planetary systems. At Disk Detective, you&#39;ll view 10-second videos of images from NASA telescopes and help us decide if they might be stars with dusty disks where planets form and dwell.  The best candidates you find get followed-up with other telescopes so we can learn more about how planets are born.
