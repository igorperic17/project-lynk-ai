# 2016 National Parks BioBlitz -Â Colonial Insect Blitz

This bioblitz will be a day long event looking at a specific species of pollinating insects. We plan on having an evening moth component as well. The park is recruiting county and urban school districts for middle school participation as part of the Director&#39;s Call to Action. This purpose is to observe and identify as many species as possible within one day. It is the intent that this begins an annual effort to inventory as many insects in the park to develop an inventory of insects in the park using citizen science.
