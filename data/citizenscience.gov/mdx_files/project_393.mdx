# Dynamics of Creativity and Innovation in Virtual Scientific Commons

This research aims to improve socio-technical understanding of  scientific  communities  that  collaborate  over  the  cyberinfrastructure.  The  major  contribution  is  the development  of  a computer  simulation  framework  for  the  discovery  of  and policy  analysis  for  virtual  scientific community  designs  that  are  innovative  and  sustainable.
