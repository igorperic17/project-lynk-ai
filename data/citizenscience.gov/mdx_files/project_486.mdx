project_description: "The project collects oral histories from expert fishermen to explore how the culture, traditions, and fishing techniques for the Hawaii bottomfish fishery have evolved from Native Hawaiian populations to modern times. Documenting the bottomfish &quot;family tree&quot;, traditional knowledge, techniques, adaptations, culture and traditions including fish sharing will improve our understanding of changes in the fishery over time and provide valuable insights. These could allow for consideration of traditional values in management programs, improve our interpretation of historical data, and ensure sustainable management for the future."

# Hawaii Bottomfish Heritage Project - Tracing Traditions and Preserving Culture

The project collects oral histories from expert fishermen to explore how the culture, traditions, and fishing techniques for the Hawaii bottomfish fishery have evolved from Native Hawaiian populations to modern times. Documenting the bottomfish &quot;family tree&quot;, traditional knowledge, techniques, adaptations, culture and traditions including fish sharing will improve our understanding of changes in the fishery over time and provide valuable insights. These could allow for consideration of traditional values in management programs, improve our interpretation of historical data, and ensure sustainable management for the future.
