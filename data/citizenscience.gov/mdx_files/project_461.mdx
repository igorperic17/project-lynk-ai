# Bonnyvale Environmental Education Center: Picture Post

The Picture Post Project is a part of the Digital Earth Watch (DEW) network. The post, to be installed near the summit of Heifer Hill at BEEC, will enable visitors to help with the creation of a time-lapse sequence of photos that will document the growth of plants 360Â° around this picture post throughout the year, and hopefully years to come, and to monitor changes in the climate.
