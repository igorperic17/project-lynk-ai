# Exoplanet Watch

When you look up into the night sky, do you wonder what&#39;s out there beyond our solar system? So do we! Come join us in learning more about exoplanets, the worlds that orbit distant stars. You don&#39;t need to own a telescope in order to participate. We can give you archived data from robotic telescopes to process with our free EXOTIC software. If you do have a telescope with a tracking mount, we can show you how to observe exoplanets yourself.
