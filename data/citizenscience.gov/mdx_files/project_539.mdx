project_description: "The Youth Forest Monitoring Program (YFMP) is a 7-week citizen science program for high school students during the summer months. Over the last 20 years, YFMP students have collected key forest health data from permanent monitoring sites on the Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest.  Students are trained by Forest Service scientists during the first week of the program and assisted by field instructors throughout the summer.  Students analyze their data and present their findings and management recommendations at the end of the program to an audience of forest scientists, county commissioners, and the public. YFMP students make a real difference across the forest and have contributed to known baseline data for the forest plan revision process."
