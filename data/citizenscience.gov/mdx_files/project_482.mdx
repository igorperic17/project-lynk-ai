Citizen scientists like you can help NASA scientists to build the largest open global landslide catalog, the Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository (COOLR), using our web application Landslide Reporter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our goal is to open access to and quantity of landslide data on a global scale to save lives and property. Your reports are key towards guiding awareness of landslide hazards for improving scientific modeling and emergency response.
